  In Preferences/Settings | Keymap, you can search by shortcut or by action name and see the assigned shortcut. 
  
  Alternatively, you can use the [Find Action](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/guide/tips/toggle-options-in-find/) command for that: Press *Cmd+Shift+A/Ctrl+Shift+A*, look for an action, then you'll see its name with a shortcut if it exists.
