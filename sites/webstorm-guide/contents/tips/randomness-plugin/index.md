  Install the *Randomness* plugin from *Preferences/Settings | Plugins* if you're getting stuck coming up with some random data for your project. This plugin allows you to insert random numbers, strings, and UUIDs.
  
  To insert random data, press *Alt+R* and choose the type of data you want to insert. A different value will be inserted each time you use the action.
