  Switch to the **Distraction-free** mode with *Ctrl+` | View Mode | Enter Distraction Free Mode* 
  whenever you need to focus on coding – you’ll get the source code centered and 
  all the UI elements hidden.

  If you want to get rid of every part of the IDE except your code, you can combine the 
  full screen and distraction-free modes by entering the **Zen** mode: *Ctrl+` | View Mode | Enter Zen Mode.*

  To exit the modes, hit *Ctrl+`* and navigate to *View Mode | Exit Distraction Free (or Zen) Mode.*
