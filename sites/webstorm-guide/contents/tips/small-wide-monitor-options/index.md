  If you have a small monitor, you can maximize the screen estate by removing the navigation bar or any other options under *View | Appearance* in the main menu. You can also try switching to [Distraction-free or Zen](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/ide-viewing-modes.html) viewing modes.
  
  For widescreen monitors, go to *Preferences/Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance*. Try turning on:
  
  - *Widescreen tool window layout* maximizes the height of vertical tool windows by limiting the width of horizontal tool windows.
  - *Side-by-side layout on the left/right* displays vertical tool windows in two columns instead of stacked on top of each other.
