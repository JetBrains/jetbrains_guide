  *If re-indenting your code or fixing long lines doesn't 
  sound fun, let GoLand do it for you.*

  If there's one action that you'll do constantly, it's this one: 
  ``Reformat Code`` makes it a piece of cake to fix style warnings.

Perhaps you copy and pasted some code with a different line length than your
other code. Or you join a project where the other have sinned against all the
gods with their heretical indentation spacing. Tabs?!

GoLand makes it easy to set code styles in wildly flexible ways (project
vs. IDE, EditorConfig files, inline markers to suppress, etc.)
But GoLand makes it even easier to apply those code styles with the
`Reformat Code` action.

This action has an easy shortcut and can be applied to an entire file,
a selection, or across many files in the project. With GoLand Professional,
you can also use it outside of Python, in JavaScript, CSS, etc.
