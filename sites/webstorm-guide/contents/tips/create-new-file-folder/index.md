  Focus on the [*Project* tool window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/project-tool-window.html) and press *Cmd+N/Alt+Insert* - WebStorm will open the *New* popup. Use this popup to add a new file quickly. You can also create a new folder for that new file: type the name of the folder (or folders) and then add / before the file name.
