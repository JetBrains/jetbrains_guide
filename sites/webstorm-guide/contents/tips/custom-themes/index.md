  WebStorm comes with a few [predefined themes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/user-interface-themes.html), but thereâ€™s also a variety of custom options out there to choose from. 
  
  To explore the custom themes that are available, go to *Preferences/Settings | Plugins* and search the marketplace for *theme*. If none of the existing themes suit your needs, you can also create your [own](https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes_intro.html).
