  Want to make your progress bar look a bit nicer? The Nyan Progress Bar plugin (*Preferences/Settings | Plugins*) can help you with that.
  
  If you donâ€™t like Nyan Cat but still like the idea of customizing the progress bar, there are a couple of alternatives available, such as [Hadouken](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12453-hadouken-progress-bar) and [Duck Progress Bar](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11602-duck-progress-bar) plugins.
