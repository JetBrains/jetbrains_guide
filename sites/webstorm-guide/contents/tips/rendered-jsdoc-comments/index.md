  Reading JSDoc comments in the editor can be a challenge because of all the tags you have to wade through. To make it a bit easier, you can try rendering those comments in the editor.
  
  To try this feature out, click the icon in the gutter, next to the comments, and youâ€™ll see documentation comments displayed without any distractions. You can also right-click to adjust the font size for better readability.
