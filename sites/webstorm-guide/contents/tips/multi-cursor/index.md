  Multi-cursor selection in WebStorm:
  - Select next occurrence of the current word or selection: *Ctrl+G* on macOS and *Alt+J* on Windows and Linux
  - Select all occurrences: *Ctrl+Cmd+G* / *Shift+Ctrl+Alt+J*
  - To add or remove multiple carets, you can also press and hold the *Alt* key, then click at the next location of the caret. Alternatively, to add multiple carets, you can press *Alt/Ctrl* twice, and then without releasing it, press the *Up* or *Down* arrow keys. You can also make a multiple selection by pressing *Shift+Alt* and dragging the caret.
  - To delete all carets, press the *Escape* key.
