  You finished your work. Now you have to write...a meaningful commit message? "Ugh, I just want to move on to the next issue." 
  
  Let the IDE help. Often you want your commit message to refer to a file. We make it easy by autocompletion of filenames. Not just that...we only show files that were changed in the commit.
