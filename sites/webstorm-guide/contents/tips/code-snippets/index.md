  Code snippets, or _Live Templates_ as they are called in JetBrains IDEs, can help you save and reuse code. To use them, type the _Live Template_ abbreviation and press _⇥ / Tab_ to expand it. You can also press _⌘J / Ctrl+J_ to check what code snippets are available in the current context.

  To see the full list of available code snippets, go to _Preferences / Settings | Editor | Live Templates_.
