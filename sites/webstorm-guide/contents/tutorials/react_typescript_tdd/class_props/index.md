In the previous step we made a "dumb" presentational component with one property.
In React, components can have properties and state. 
When they have state (or when they need access to React's lifecycle methods), we use a class-based component instead.
In recent years, React has made these available to functional components as well.

We're going to build a stateful counter component.
Each click increments the click count, with the current count value stored in local component state.
The `<Counter/>` component will be passed in some props. 
In this step, we'll show component props -- as done with a function in the previous step -- for class-based components. 
We'll do state in the next step, followed by event handlers.

## Code

The finished code for this tutorial step is 
[in the repository](https://github.com/JetBrains/jetbrains_guide/tree/master/sites/webstorm-guide/demos/tutorials/react_typescript_tdd/class_props).

## First a Test

This tutorial series shows class-based component development using testing instead of a browser. 
Let's write a broken test first, then do the implementation which fixes the test.

Make a new file called `Counter.test.tsx` with this test, to ensure we have a label and a current count:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { Counter } from "./Counter";

test("should render a label and counter", () => {
  const { getByTitle } = render(<Counter />);
  const label = getByTitle("Count Label");
  expect(label).toBeInTheDocument();
  const count = getByTitle("Current Count");
  expect(count).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

The test fails, but even more quickly, TypeScript immediately tells you that you are missing an import.
Good, we're doing TDD!

Now create a file `Counter.tsx`. We'll make it a very simple class to start:

```typescript
import React, { Component } from "react";

export class Counter extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <span title="Count Label">Count</span>
        <span id="counter" title="Current Count">
          1
        </span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Back in our test, click on `<Counter/>` and hit `Alt-Enter` to resolve the import. 
Save the file and see that your test passes:

Not a bad first step.

## Pass In a Prop

As we did in the previous step, we'll use a consistent process:

- Work first in the test by writing a *failing* test

- Then fix the `Counter` presentation component

- Then fix the wrapper component that uses the `Counter`

Thus, let's add a test for the case of passing in a label:

```typescript
test("should render a counter with custom label", () => {
  const { getByTitle } = render(<Counter label={`Current`} />);
  const label = getByTitle("Current Count");
  expect(label).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

The test fails, which is good -- the label is still `Count`, not `Current`. 
What's even better -- TypeScript helped us "fail faster". 
Before running the test, it told us we broke the contract saying no properties were expected. 
Even better, our IDE visually warned us with a red squiggly.

Let's now work on the implementation.
Classes handle props with defaults a little differently:

```typescript
export class Counter extends Component<{ label?: string }> {
}
```

`Component` is a "generic" type, with 0, 1, or 2 parameters in between the `<>`.
We have one parameter...for the shape of the props.
As we did in the previous step, let's move the *inline* prop definition to a standalone, exported type:

```typescript
export type CounterProps = { label?: string };

export class Counter extends Component<CounterProps> {
}
```

The type definition says `label` can be optional.
Can we define a default prop value, as we did for functions?
Yes, and [a clever approach](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/default_props/) using destructuring and defaults comes into play:
 
```typescript
export class Counter extends Component<CounterProps> {
  render() {
    const { label = "Count" } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <span title="Count Label">{label}</span>
        <span id="counter" title="Current Count">
          1
        </span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
``` 

Inside `render` we made a local `const` for the `label` value.
Its value was "destructured" from the props, and when not in props, was given a default value.
With this...our test passes!

## Wire Into UI

We have a `<Counter/>` component that takes an optional label.
Tests pass.
Let's now use it in our app and, at long last, view it in the browser.

Open `App.tsx` and change the TSX that in `render`:

```typescript
render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Heading/>
            <Counter label={'Current'}/>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Did you notice the autocompletion by the IDE, which knew there was a component with a name starting with those letters, somewhere in the project? 
And when you accepted the completion, it generated the import?
Also, the IDE helped on the available props and the types for those props.

All of our tests still pass.
Let's change the `renders hello react` test in `App.test.tsx` to look for the label in the new `<Counter/>` child component:

```typescript
test("renders hello react", () => {
  const { getByTitle, getByText } = render(<App />);
  const linkElement = getByText(/hello react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  const label = getByTitle("Count Label");
  expect(label).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Now restart the `start` script and look at the UI in the browser.
We should now see `Current1` in the UI.

While this step didn't do too much that was new -- after all, we had optional props and interfaces in the previous step, with functions -- it paves the way for stateful components.
