  Go 1.16 introduced a new feature called *go:embed*.
  
  This works using a compiler directive, *//go:embed*, and a
  variable, or more, of type *string*, *[]byte*, or *embed.FS*.
  
  If you want to embed a directory, then you must use the *embed.FS*
  type for the variable in which you need to embed the content.

  **How to use:**
  You don't need to do anything special to get the IDE to support
  this feature.

  Open any Go 1.16, or newer, based project, and embed what you need.
