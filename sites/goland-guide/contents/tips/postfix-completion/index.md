    **Postfix Completion** lets you transform an expression into another one
    , based on the postfix you specify after the dot, the current context, and the expression type.
    
    For example, you can turn a bool expression into an if statement, or create a pointer to an expression. If anything goes not as planned, everything can be reverted via simple _Cmd+Z_ on macOS or _Ctrl+Z_ on Windows/Linux.
    
    *Pro tip:*
    
    - _Postfix Completion_ options are displayed as a part of the `Basic Completion` suggestions list. Press _âŒ˜+J_ on macOS or _Ctrl+J_ on Windows/Linux to see a full list of the _Postfix Completion_ templates applicable in the current context.
    - You can change the names of all _Postfix Completions_ in the settings dialog.
    - In the same dialog, you can also disable the templates you don't need, or even turn off _Postfix Completion_ completely.
    
    **How to use:**
    
    Open the _Postfix Completion_ page via _Settings/Preferences | Editor | General_ to see the complete list of supported templates. Learn, play, and of course, enjoy!
