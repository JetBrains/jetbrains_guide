    Regardless if it's for fun, or investigating a bug, having a quick look at what the application is doing and its memory is always useful.

    **How to use:**

    Either attach to the project using the debugger, or launch a debugging session. While the application is running, press the ðŸ“· button on the left side of the Debugger Tool Window.
