    **Live Templates** are great for reducing the time you spend writing
    frequently used portions of code, like variable and loop declarations, 
    or test functions.

    Of course, you can edit, rename, turn off, or remove any of the predefined
    Live Templates, but what about adding your own? That is quite a interesting
    topic that we will cover in the upcoming articles about GoLand features.

    How to use

    Open *Settings/Preferences | Editor | Live Templates * to see the full list
    of already supported templates. Learn, play, and again, enjoy!
