  Do you need to access your struct fields via getters and setters?
  Add all the boilerplate code you need using the dedicated
  *Generate getter and setter* action.

  **How to use:**
  Select a struct type, then press _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or
  _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_ and choose *Generate getter and setter* from the
  list of available actions.

  Choose which fields should have these methods generated, then press
  *OK* to generate them.

  Choose the receiver name and receiver type then continue working on
  your code as usual.

  **Pro tip:** You can choose either all fields, or select the 
  individual fields that need to have these methods generated.
