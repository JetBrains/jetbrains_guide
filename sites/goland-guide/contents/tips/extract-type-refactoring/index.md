  If you have an anonymous type defined, you can extract it into a
  standalone type and reuse it across your code.

  **How to use:**
  Invoke the *Refactor this* feature, _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T on
  Windows/Linux_, and _^ + T on macOS_, on the anonymous type, then
  select the *Extract type* from the list of available
  refactorings.

  Give it a name and start reusing the newly created type in your
  code.
