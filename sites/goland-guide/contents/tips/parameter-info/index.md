    *See what's needed in a function, as you type, without disruption.*    

    Have a function with lots of arguments? `Parameter Info` gives just 
    the basics without using lots of real estate.

    Some functions or structs -- well, let's admit it, can require lots of arguments.

    So you stop, go look at the function, and come back to what you were doing.

    There's a better way. With your cursor in the parentheses, invoke
    `Parameter Info` (`Ctrl-P` Win/Linux, `Cmd-P` macOS). You get a tiny
    popup with the positional and keyword arguments, along with any default
    values. Bold is used to mark the current spot in the parameter list that
    your cursor is at.

    You can invoke this before you type any parameters, after you've typed
    a few, or later if you come back to make a change.
