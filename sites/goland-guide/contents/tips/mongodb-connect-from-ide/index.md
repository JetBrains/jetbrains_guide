    **How to use:**

    To connect to a MongoDB database, head over to the _Database_ tool window on the the right side of the IDE and click on the _+_ (_New_) button. Select _Data Source_ then _MongoDB_ as the data source type. Customize the name of the data source, connection details, then click on the _Test_ link to ensure everything is ok.

    Once everything is done, a _Console_ tab will appear and you can now query the database from the IDE. You can also explore it from the _Database_ tool window, and select which parts to hide or show from it.

    **Note:** You may need to download a database driver for the IDE first. If you see a _Download driver_ link, you'll need to click on that before you can connect to the database.
