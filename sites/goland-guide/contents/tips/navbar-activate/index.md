  *The no-distraction way to work with your files.*

  A minimal UI means no project tool window or _Navigation Bar_.  But
  how do you then move around files?

  Bring the _Navigation Bar_, Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ↑ on macOS_, up as-needed, without the mouse. Do
  what you need, then the popup disappears.
