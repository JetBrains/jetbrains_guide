What if you are in a file and you quickly want to jump to a certain definition? You 
could invoke the Find feature, which would work, as long as you remember the type of 
that element. But what if you don't, or what if it's a new code base thatâ€™s not yet 
familiar to you, then the File Structure popup window has your back.

Use Ctrl+F12 and a window with all the elements defined in the current file will 
show up. Press Ctrl+F12 again with the window still open, and it will show all the 
elements defined in the package of the current file. Speed Typing can then help you 
to narrow down the list of elements to the one that you need.
