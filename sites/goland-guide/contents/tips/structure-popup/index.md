    The **File Structure** popup window allows you to get an overview of all the elements defined in a file or a package.

    You can use it to navigate to any definition and invoke it from anywhere.
    
    **How to use:**

    Use _Ctrl + F12 on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + F12 on macOS_, and a window with all
    the elements defined in the current file will show up.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    Press _Ctrl + F12 on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + F12 on macOS_, again with the window
    still open, and it will show all the elements defined in the package of the current file.
    
    _Speed Typing_ can then help you to narrow down the list of elements to the one that you need.
