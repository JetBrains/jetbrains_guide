    What if you are in a file, and you quickly want to jump to a certain definition?
    
    You could invoke the _Find_ feature, which would work, as long as you remember
    the type of that element. But what if you don't, or what if it's a new code base
    not yet familiar to you, then the _File Structure_ popup window has your back.
    
    Use _Ctrl + F12_ on Windows/Linux or _⌘ + F12_ on macOS, and a window with all
    the elements defined in the current file will show up.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    Press _Ctrl + F12_ on Windows/Linux or _⌘ + F12_ on macOS, again with the window
    still open, and it will show all the elements defined in the package of the current
    file.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    _Speed Typing_ can then help you to narrow down the list of elements to the one
    that you need.
