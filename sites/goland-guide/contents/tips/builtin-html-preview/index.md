  **How to use:**
  Hover the cursor on the top right side of the IDE and click on the 
  IDE icon next to the browsers ones.

  An embedded browser tool window will show up. You can the make 
  changes to the template file and have them show up in the IDE
  without having to switch to a standalone browser.

  When you are done, close it like you would any other tool window.

  **Pro tip:** Your IDE uses <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jcef">JCEF</a>
  to display the page, which is based on the Chromium browser.
