  GoLand has an inspection that reports usages of empty interfaces used as a type or type constraint. To fix such usages, try the *Replace with 'any'* intention action.

  **How to use:**
  Place the cursor on an empty interface, press _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_, and select *Replace with 'any'*.
