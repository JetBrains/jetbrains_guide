    Multiple selections is a very powerful feature in the editor, that lets you quickly 
    select and edit multiple pieces of code at once.
    
    **How to use:**

    Select something as you normally would, or press _Alt + J on Windows/Linux_, 
    _^ + G on macOS_, to select the symbol at the caret.
    
    GoLand will search through the current file until it finds a matching piece of text, 
    which it then adds to the selection.
    
    You can press _Alt + J_ again to go forward further, or _â‡§ + Alt + J_ to go back.
    When the search reaches the end of the file, it will start over again from the beginning.
