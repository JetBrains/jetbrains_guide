Multiple selections is a very powerful feature in the editor, that lets you quickly 
select and edit multiple pieces of code at once.

Select something as you normally would, or press Alt+J on Windows and Linux to 
select the symbol at the caret.

GoLand will search through the current file until it finds a matching piece of text, 
which it then adds to the selection. You can press Alt+J again to go forward 
further, or Shift+Alt+J to go back. When the search reaches the end of the file, it 
will start over again from the beginning
