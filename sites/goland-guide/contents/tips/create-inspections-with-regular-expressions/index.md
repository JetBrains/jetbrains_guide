  Open settings, go to _Editor | Inspections_, and press the **Add** icon. Select **Add RegExp Search Inspectionâ€¦** from the list and you will be directed to a dialog where you can set up your new inspection. Select the desired language, use hints from the panel on the left to build a RegExp, and designate the required replacement. You can also specify the severity of how the IDE should highlight found cases in the project.
