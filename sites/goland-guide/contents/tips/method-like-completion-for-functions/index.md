    **Method-like completion for functions** allows you to search for functions
     based on their first parameter.
    
    Imagine you are new to Go and want to split a string.
    
    You know that there must be a function for that, most likely it's
    called `Split` and accepts a string as the first argument,
    but you don't know the exact name of the function and its package.
    
    Here's where method-like completion comes in handy, offering you
    a list of all suitable functions, automatically importing it upon selection.
    
    **How to use:**

    Hold down the _Ctrl_ key and press _Space_ twice.
