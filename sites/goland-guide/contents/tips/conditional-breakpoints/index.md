    *Stop stepping.*

    Have a breakpoint in a loop and find yourself clicking **Continue**
    repeatedly? Change your breakpoint to only stop when a condition is met.
    
    **How to use:**

    Edit the breakpoint properties via _Ctrl + Shift + F8 on Windows/Linux_,
    or _⇧ + ⌘ + F8 on macOS_, then type in the **Condition** you want.
