Regardless of whether you keep it displayed or not, the navigation bar has a useful 
feature that can help you get an overview of both your current location, and the 
structure of the project itself.

Press Alt+Home and it will appear. Use the Arrow keys to move around inside and 
press Enter to enter a certain folder or Esc to exit from it.

As you have probably guessed already by now, Speed Search is available here as well, 
and it will help you quickly filter the files in your view.
