    Regardless of whether you keep it displayed or not, the _Navigation Bar_ has a useful
    feature that can help you get an overview of both your current location and the
    structure of the project itself.
    
    Press _Alt + Home_ on Windows/Linux, _⌘ + ↑_ on macOS, and it will appear. Use the
    _Arrow keys_ to move around inside and press _Enter_ to enter a certain folder or
    _Esc_ to exit from it.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    As you have probably guessed already by now, _Speed Search_ is available here as well,
    and it will help you quickly filter the files in your view.
