    The **Navigation Bar** has a useful feature that can help you get an overview of both your current location and the
    structure of the project itself.

    **How to use:**

    Press _Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + ↑ on macOS_, and it will appear.

    Use the _Arrow keys_ to move around inside and press _Enter_ to enter a certain folder or
    _Esc_ to exit from it.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    _Speed Search_ is available here and it will help you quickly filter the files in your view.
