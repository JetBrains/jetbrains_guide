    GoLand can complete statements and add required trailing commas for any 		
     composite literals (like struct, slice, etc.), and even place caret in a 		
     position where you can just start typing the next statement.

    After typing parentheses, trigger the Complete Current Statement action, ⇧+⌘+↩︎  on macOS and ⇧+⌃+↩︎ on Windows/Linux, to add curly braces and move the cursor down to the beginning of the next row.
