    There are a lot of (tool) windows opening or appearing when using the IDE. 
    
    How can we quickly get back to the editor?
    
    We can press the _Esc_ key, and the focus will switch back to the editor.
    
    The tool window you're switching from will preserve its visibility state in this case.
