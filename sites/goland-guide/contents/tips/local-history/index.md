    **Local History** will come to the rescue whenever just deleted all the work you did for days by mistake.
    
    **How to use:**
    
    You can invoke it at any time by using the **Local History** command either via
    _Search Everywhere_, or by right-clicking on the folder/file.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    You can also see the difference between different points in time, and you can put
    labels on known points in time to make sure you can always return to a safe state.
    
    Labels get automatically added when tests pass, for example.
    
    By default, changes are retained for 5 days, but 
    [this is configurable](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/local-history.html#retention).
