    Do you want to select all the occurrences of a piece of code?
    
    **How to use:**
    
    Press _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + J on Windows/Linux_, and _âŒ˜ + ^ + G on macOS_.
    
    After the selection is complete, you can start editing all the fragments
    as if they were all the same one.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    If you plan to use this feature to rename something,
    then you should have a look at our [Rename refactoring](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2018/12/07/refactorings-in-goland-rename-refactoring/), which is designed
    to work safely across multiple packages, not just at the file level,
    with full preview and undo support.
