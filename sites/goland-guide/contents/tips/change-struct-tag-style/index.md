    Need to change the case of struct tag keys?

    Choose between *snake_case*, *(lower) camelCase*,
    *(upper) CamelCase*, or *kebap-case* and apply this to the whole
    struct in a few steps.

    **How to use:**

    Place the cursor on a struct field, then invoke the
    *Context Actions* menu via _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_
    or _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_.

    Select the *Change field name style in tags*, and choose 
    between one of the four styles available.
