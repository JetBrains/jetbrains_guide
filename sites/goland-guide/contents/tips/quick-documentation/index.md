    *Want to learn what a symbol is about, without going to a browser?*

    The IDE knows the symbol, its argument names/types/defaults, the
    documentation it has.
    Let it give you a non-interrupting window, letting you get back to work.

    **How to use:**
    
    Invoke the **Quick Documentation** feature using `Ctrl + Q` on Windows/Linux
    or `F1` on macOS, learn more about the different symbols you're working with.
