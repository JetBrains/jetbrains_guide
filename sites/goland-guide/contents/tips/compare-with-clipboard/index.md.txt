GoLand has a built-in diff viewer for code, revisions, and even images. To invoke 
it, select any pair of files and press Ctrl+D on Windows/Linux and Cmd+D on macOS.

If you have selected a single file, the IDE will prompt you to select another file 
to compare it to. To quickly compare the editor with the clipboard, choose View |
