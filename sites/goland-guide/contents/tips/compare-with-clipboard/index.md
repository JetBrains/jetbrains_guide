    GoLand has a built-in diff viewer for code, revisions, and even images.
    
    **How to use:**

    Select any pair of files and press _Ctrl + D on Windows/Linux_ and _âŒ˜ + D on macOS_.
    
    **Pro tip:**

    To quickly compare the editor with the clipboard, choose _View | Compare with Clipboard_.

    If you have selected a single file, the IDE will prompt you to select another
    file to compare it to.
