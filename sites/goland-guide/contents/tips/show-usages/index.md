    The **Show usages** feature allows you to quickly answer the question "Where's this element used?"
    
    It will open a pop-up that you can quickly
    use to navigate/filter or otherwise dismiss with the results you are looking for.

    **How to use:**

    Press _Ctrl + Alt + F7 on Windows/Linux_, _⌥ + ⌘ + F7 on macOS_.
