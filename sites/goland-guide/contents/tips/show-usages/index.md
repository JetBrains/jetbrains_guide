    A question that often comes up when working with code is: where’s this element used?
    
    GoLand has the _Find usages_ action, _Alt + F7_ on Windows/Linux, _⌥ + F7_ on macOS,
    to help you out with that.
    
    What about not having a tool window for this, but rather a popup that you can quickly
    use to navigate/filter or otherwise dismiss? That's where GoLand comes in with the
    _Show usages_ feature, accessible via _Ctrl + Alt + F7_ on Windows/Linux,
    _⌥ + ⌘ + F7_ on macOS.
