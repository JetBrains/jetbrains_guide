A question that often comes up when working with code is: where's this element used? 
GoLand has the Find usages action, Alt+F7, to help you out with that.

But what about not having a tool window for this, but rather a popup that you can 
quickly use to navigate/filter or otherwise dismiss? That's where GoLand comes in 
with the Show usages feature, accessible via Alt+Ctrl+F7.
