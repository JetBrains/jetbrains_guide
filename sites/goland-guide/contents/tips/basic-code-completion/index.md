    **Basic completion** provides a list of _all symbols_ available at the current caret position.
    
    The list will include the usual mix of type, interface, and method names, keywords, and also _Live Templates_.
    
    _Symbols from not-yet-imported packages_ are also offered, with autoimport on-the-fly when you select them.
    
    How to use
    
    Basic completion pops up as you start typing code and GoLand recognizes an opportunity to complete something for you, but you can invoke it anytime by pressing _‚åÉSpace_ on macOS or _Ctrl+Space_ on Windows/Linux.
    
    _Quick tip_: Basic Code Completion is also available for non-English symbols.
