    **Basic completion** provides a list of _all symbols_ available at the current caret position.
    
    The list will include the usual mix of type, interface, and method names, keywords, and also _Live Templates_.
    
    _Symbols from not-yet-imported packages_ are also offered, with autoimport on-the-fly when you select them.
    
    **How to use:**
    
    Basic completion pops up as you start typing code and GoLand recognizes
     an opportunity to complete something for you, but you can invoke it anytime by pressing _Ctrl + Space on Windows/Linux_ or _âŒƒ + Space on macOS_.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    _Basic Code Completion_ is also available for non-English symbols.
