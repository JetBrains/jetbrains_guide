With Extend selection Ctrl+W on Windows/Linux and⌥↑ on macOS, you can quickly 
select parts of your code using semantic knowledge about it.

Extend selection is complemented by the Shrink Selection, Ctrl+Shift+W on Windows 
and Linux and ⌥↓ on macOS, which lets you shrink the selection made, using the same 
semantic knowledge of the source code.
