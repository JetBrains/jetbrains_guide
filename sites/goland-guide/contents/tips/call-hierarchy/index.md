    **Call Hierarchy** allows you to quickly see all the places where a function or method is used.
    
    **How to use:**

    Press _Ctrl + Alt + H on Windows/Linux_, _‚å• + ^ + H on macOS_, and the 
    _Call Hierarchy_ tool window will open up with all the places that the function is called inside.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    This works for interface methods, type methods, methods, and calls.

    You can then drill down into the call chain to see where those other functions are called.

    _Speed Typing_ is available to help you quickly navigate to the element you need.
