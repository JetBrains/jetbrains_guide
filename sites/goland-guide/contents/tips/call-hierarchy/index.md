    If you want to quickly see all the places where a function or method is used,
    then _Call Hierarchy_ is the feature you are looking for.
    
    Press _Ctrl + Alt + H_ on Windows/Linux, _‚å• + ^ + H_ on macOS, and the 
    _Call Hierarchy_ tool window will open up with all the places that the function
    is called inside.
    
    You can then drill down into the call chain to see where those other functions
    are called.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    This works for interface methods, type methods, methods, and calls.


    **Pro tip:**
    _Speed Typing_ is available to help you quickly navigate to the element you need.
