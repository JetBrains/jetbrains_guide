If you want to quickly see all the places where a function or method is being used, 
then Call Hierarchy is the feature you are looking for.

Press Ctrl+Alt+H and the Call Hierarchy tool window will open up with all the places 
that the function is called inside.You can then drill down into the call chain to 
see where those other functions are called.

This works for interface methods, type methods, methods, and calls.

And of course, Speed Typing is again available to help you quickly navigate to the 
element you need.
