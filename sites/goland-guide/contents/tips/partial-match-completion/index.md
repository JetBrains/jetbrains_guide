    GoLand provides completion suggestions when you typed only a part of a 
    word (any part, even characters from somewhere in the middle).
    
    Also, case-insensitive [CamelHump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase)
    completion is supported, so you can just type the capital letters along with a
    number of subsequent characters. For example, type _ReWrCl_ to get 
    _io.ReadWriteCloser_.
    
    **How to use**
    
    Works automatically, you don't have to do anything.
