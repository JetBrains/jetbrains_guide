    Use **Navigate to Symbol** to jump between symbols in your project
    and stop thinking about the file they are in.

    **How to use:**  
    Invoke it using _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ⌥ + O on macOS_
    to bring up the search window and quickly navigate your way in the project.
