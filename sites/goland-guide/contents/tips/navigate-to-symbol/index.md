  *The best way to move around the code in your project.*

  Want to get from A to B? Don't think of B as files. Think
  in terms of code.

  We are hardwired to think of moving around the "files" in our
  project. However, we have a smart IDE that makes it fast to jump to
  the symbols in our code.
  
  Use _Navigate to Symbol_, _Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ⌥ + O on macOS_ to bring up the search window and quickly navigate your way in the project.
