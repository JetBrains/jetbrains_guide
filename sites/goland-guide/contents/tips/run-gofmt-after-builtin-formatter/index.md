  Make sure your code is always formatted with gofmt.

  **How to use:**

  To use this feature, check the `On code reformat` option under `Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Go | Other`.

  Now you can use the default shortcut, `Ctrl + Alt + L` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Alt + L` on macOS, to trigger the builtin formatter.

  **Pro tip**: You can also search for `Run gofmt` in the IDE `Settings/Preferences`, and activate the option as described above.
