    *Language-aware line adding, no muss no fuss.*

    It seems like a simple thing, but many forget about it. You
    want a new line, so you first move to the end of the current
    line and press _Enter_. A line above? Worse. There's a better way.
    
    Press _Shift + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _⇧ + Enter on macOS_, and you can add a line and place the cursor on it. 
    
    Press _Ctrl + Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ⌥ + Enter on macOS_ to add a line above.
