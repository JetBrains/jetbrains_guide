    What if you need to select the currently selected file in a particular tool window,
    e.g. the _Project_ or the _Changes view_ tool windows? Or even in _Explorer/Finder_?
    
    This is where the _Select in..._ action, available via _Alt + F1_ on Windows/Linux,
    _‚å• + F1_ on macOS, comes in handy.
