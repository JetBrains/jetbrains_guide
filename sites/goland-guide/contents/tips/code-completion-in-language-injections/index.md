    _databases statements_, _JavaScript_, _CSS_, _HTML_, _XML_, and _RegExp_, etc.

    Place the cursor within the literal (_between_ the quotation marks) and press 
    _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_, select **Inject language or reference**,
    choose which one of supported injection language you want to use and 
    start typing, auto-completion will appear instantly.
