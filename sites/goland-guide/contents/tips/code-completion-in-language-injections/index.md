    GoLand provides code completion and analysis in injected strings for SQL and 
    databases statements, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, XML, and RegExp, etc.

    Place the cursor within the literal (between the quotation marks) and press 
    _⌥+⏎_ on macOS or _Alt+Enter_ on Windows/Linux, select _Inject language or 
    reference_, choose which one of supported injection language you want to use and 
    start typing, auto-completion will appear instantly.
