Since you'll likely be opening files, lots of them, during an editing session how
can you quickly switch between them? The Switcher, Ctrl+Tab, is here to help you. 

You can use it to quickly switch between the previous file and the current one using 
the shortcut.

Alternatively, use the shortcut but then hold Ctrl, and you will be able to use 
Ctrl+Tab again to move forward through the list of options, or press Shift+Tab and 
move backward.
