    The **Switcher** allows you to quickly move between open files during your editing session.
    
    **How to use:**

    Invoke the **Switcher** using _Ctrl + Tab on Windows/Linux_ or _^ + Tab on macOS_.

    **Pro tip:**

    You can use it to quickly switch between the previous file and the current one using the shortcut.
    
    If you want to browse the whole list, use the shortcut and hold _Ctrl on Windows/Linux_ or _Shift on macOS_.
    You will be able to use _Ctrl + Tab on Windows/Linux_ or _^ + Tab on macOS_ again
    to move forward through the list of options, or press _Shift + Tab_ and move backward.
