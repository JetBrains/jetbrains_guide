    Since you'll likely be opening files, lots of them, during an editing session how
    can you quickly switch between them? The _Switcher_, _Ctrl + Tab_ on Windows/Linux or
    _^ + Tab_ on macOS, is here to help you. 
    
    You can use it to quickly switch between the previous file and the current one using 
    the shortcut.

    **Pro tip:**
    
    Alternatively, use the shortcut but then hold _Ctrl_ on Windows/Linux or _Shift_ on macOS,
    and you will be able to use _Ctrl + Tab_ on Windows/Linux or _^ + Tab_ on macOS again
    to move forward through the list of options, or press _Shift + Tab_ and move backward.
