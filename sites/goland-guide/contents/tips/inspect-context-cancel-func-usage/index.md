    **How to use:**

    In code that uses a _context.WithCancel_ call, check for any warning messages. If one shows up, you can use the _Show Context Action_ menu, _Alt-Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _‚å• + Enter on macOS_, and use either the _Navigate to 'cancel' function_ or _Navigate to the end of the problematic execution path_ options from it. By using these feature, you can then gain the insight into what the IDE sees as a problematic execution path, and place the correct call to the cancel function.
