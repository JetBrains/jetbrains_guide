    *Want a cleaner UI with less noise to juggle in your head?*

    There are better choices for moving between files than tabs.
    Let's turn them off.

    Tabs are a great way to focus on the few files for a task. However,
    they have some downsides. Try disabling your tabs as a first step
    towards a more-focused, keyboard-centric workflow.

    **How to use:**
    Control the tab placement to position where the tabs are in the IDE.
    Invoke **Tab placement | None** to hide them completely.
