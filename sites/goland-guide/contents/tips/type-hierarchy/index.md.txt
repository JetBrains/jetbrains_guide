Have you ever wondered what interfaces a type implements? Or what the types are that 
implement an interface? The answer to these questions is the Type Hierarchy feature, 
invoked via Ctrl+H, which allows you to quickly show both the types that implement 
an interface and the interfaces implemented by a type. And you can dig deeper 
through the list of hierarchy to get as much information as you need.
