    Have you ever wondered what interfaces a type implements?

    Or what the types are that implement an interface?

    The answer to these questions is the _Type Hierarchy_ feature, invoked via
    _Ctrl + H_ on Windows/Linux, _^ + H_ on macOS, which allows you to quickly show both
    the types that implement an interface, and the interfaces implemented by a type.

    You can dig deeper through the list of hierarchy to get as much information as you need.
