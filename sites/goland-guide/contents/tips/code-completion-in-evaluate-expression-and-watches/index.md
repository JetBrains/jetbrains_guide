    You got it right, debugger also has code completion! GoLand provides 
    suggestions list when you evaluate the state of your application in a 
    debugging session.
    
    **How to use:**

    As you start typing in the _Evaluate Expression_, _Watches_ or _Conditional Breakpoints_ dialogs, code 
    completion will appear immediately.
