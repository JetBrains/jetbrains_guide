  *Actions, keyboard, speed search.*

  Want to use your keyboard but can't memorize all the shortcuts? Find 
  actions by search, using speed typing.

This is it, the biggest tip.

Our IDEs have an incredible number of useful actions, with many bound to 
keyboard shortcuts. You often discover one and think "That would be so 
useful!" But you then realize: "I don't want to use my mouse and I'll 
never remember shortcut number 427."

Lots of shortcuts. Different shortcuts on different operating systems. 
Too much to remember!

There's a better way: Don't. 

Instead, memorize one shortcut: `Find Action` (`Shift-Ctrl-A` Win/Linux, 
`Shift-Cmd-A` macOS). With your keyboard and one *highly-remembered* 
shortcut, you get fast access to all actions.

Invoking `Find Action` pops up the `Find` panel with tabs for `All`, 
`Classes`, `Files`, `Symbols`, and `Action`, with `Action` highlighted.

Start typing the name of the action you're looking for and the 
autocomplete filters out the choices. Grayed-out actions are not 
valid in the context. Results also show the keyboard shortcut when an 
action has one.

Or use speed typing by putting in the first few letters of each 
word in the action. For `Find in Path`, `fi pa` makes it the first-listed 
action in the results. 

One last point: `Find Action` also matches preferences, and some are 
inline toggleable. Want to disable tabs without opening 
settings/preferences? Start `Find Action` and type `wi pl no` for 
the `Window | Editor Tabs | Tabs Placement: None` preference.
