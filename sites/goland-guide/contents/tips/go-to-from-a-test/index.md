    Quickly going to a test for an element can be useful to investigate how that element
    should be used.

    Press _Ctrl + Shift + T_ on Windows/Linux, _⌘ + ⇧ + T_ on macOS, and you'll be able
    to jump to the test for an element.

    Press it again, and you'll be able to jump back to the element that is the subject of
    the test.
