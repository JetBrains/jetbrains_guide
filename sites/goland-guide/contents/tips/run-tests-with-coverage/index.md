    GoLand offers a builtin feature to allow you to run the tests
    in your project and display the coverage in a tool window as a
    summary for a package (folder) and file, and for each file,
    next to each line in the file.
    
    **How to use:**
    Launch the test with **Coverage** support and then use the
    **Coverage** tool window to navigate to your packages/files and
    see their coverage.
