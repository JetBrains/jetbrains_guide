  If you need to change your Go module's name or upgrade it to a new major, then the **Rename refactoring** has you covered.

  **How to use:**
  Place the cursor under the module name in the *go.mod* file, then
  invoke the *Refactor this* feature, _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T on
  Windows/Linux_, and _^ + T on macOS_.

  Select *Rename* from the list and change the module according to
  your needs.

  **Pro tip:** You can preview the changes by clicking on the 
  *Preview* button in the dialog or undo them with *Undo* operation.
  You can also undo the change later using the *Local history*
  feature. 

  **Pro tip:** If you upgrade your module's import path to a new
  major version, don't forget to tag the release too.
