    *Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?*

    Closed the _Project Tool Window_ and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?
    
    **How to use:**
    
    Activate the **Navigation Bar**, _Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ↑ on macOS_.
    
    Then navigate to the target, and use **Find in Path**, _Ctrl + Shift + F on Windows/Linux_
    or _⌘ + ⇧ + F on macOS_, from the keyboard.
