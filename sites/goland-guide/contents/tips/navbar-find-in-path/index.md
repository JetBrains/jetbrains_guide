    *Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?*
  
    Closed the Project Tool and need to find a file somewhere in the project 
    tree? Activate the Navigation Bar, navigate to the target, and use Find 
    in Path from the keyboard.

You want to find a file at a path in your project tree. But you've turned 
off the Project Tool. You could turn it back on, find the file, then 
turn it back off. But then you'll talk yourself into leaving it visible.

Use the Navigation Bar instead:

- Activate the Navigation Bar with 
`Navigate -> Jump to Navigation Bar` (`Alt-Home` Win/Linux, 
`Cmd-Up` macOS)

- Use the cursor keys to get to the target directory

- Speed search to select any subdirectories

Then, when your target is selected:

- Invoke `Find in Path` (`Shift+Ctrl+F` Win/Lin, `Shift+Cmd+F` on macOS) 
to bring up the `Find in Path` dialog.

Just like you would in the Project Tool. Except, no permanent real estate 
lost and the Navigation Bar appears/disappears on command. All without 
touching the mouse.
