    *Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?*

    Closed the _Project Tool Window_ and need to find a file somewhere in the project
    tree?
    
    Activate the _Navigation Bar_, Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + Up on macOS_, navigate to the target, and use _Find
    in Path_, _Ctrl + Shift + F on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ⇧ + F on macOS_, from the keyboard.
