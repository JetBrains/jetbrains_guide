  **How to use:**
  Press _. (dot)_ after the function/method call and continue to
  type the *varCheckError*, or simply *vce*, postfix completion.

  It will surround your code with the appropriate boilerplate to 
  create any missing variables that are returned and handle the error
  checking part for you.
