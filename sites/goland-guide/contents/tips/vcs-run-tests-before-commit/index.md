  **How to use:**

  Invoke the _Commit_ feature using _Ctrl + K on Windows/Linux_ and _âŒ˜ + K on macOS_, then select the _Commit options_ and check the **Run Tests** option, then select which test configuration you wish to run.

  **Note:** You must have the _Use non-modal commit interface_ activated before you can use this feature. Check your settings under _Settings/Preferences | Version Control | Commit_.

  **Pro-tip:** You can use the [Compound configuration type](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/run-debug-configuration.html#compound-configs) to run more than a single run configuration.
