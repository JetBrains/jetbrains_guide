  **How to use:**

  Invoke the `Commit` feature using _Ctrl + K on Windows/Linux_ and _Cmd + K on macOS_, then select the `Commit options` and check the `Run Tests` option, then select which test configuration you wish to run.

  **Note:** You must have the `Use non-modal commit interface` activated before you can use this feature. Check your settings under `Settings/Preferences | Version Control | Commit`.

  **Pro-tip:** You can use the [Compound configuration type](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/run-debug-configuration.html#compound-configs) to run more than a single run configuration.
