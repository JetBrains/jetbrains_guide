      The _Navigate to file_ feature, _Ctrl + Shift + N_ on Windows/Linux, _⌘ + ⇧ + O_ on macOS,
      allows us to search for a file by name, even if we know only part of it.
      
      You can use the same shortcut to search for a file in the current project only, your source code only, or all places, which means you can search in other places like Go Modules dependencies and GOROOT.
      
      **Pro tip:**
      
      As a hidden gem, try finding a directory by name.
