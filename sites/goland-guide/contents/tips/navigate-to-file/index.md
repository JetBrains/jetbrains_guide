    The **Navigate to file** feature allows us to search for a file by name, even if we know only part of it.

    You to search for a file in the current project only, your source code only, or
    all places. This means you can search in other places like _Go Modules_ dependencies and _GOROOT_.

    **How to use:**

    Press _Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + ⇧ + O on macOS_ to invoke the **Navigate to file** pop-up.
      
    **Pro tip:**
      
    As a hidden gem, try finding a directory by name.
