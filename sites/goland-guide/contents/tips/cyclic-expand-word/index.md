    **Cyclic Expand Word** helps you complete any word any from the current
    open files
    
    It's a type of code completion that analyzes your code in the visible scope,
    helps you to complete any word from any of the currently opened files,
    and provides you with suggestions from the current context,
    which can save you plenty of time when, for example,
    you are working on boilerplate code.
    
    **How to use:**

    Press _⌥+/_ on macOS or _Alt+/_ on Windows/Linux to search for matching words before the caret or choose _Code | Completion | Cyclic Expand Word_.
    
    Press _⌥+⇧/_ on macOS or _Shift+Alt+/_ on Windows/Linux for searching words after the caret or choose _Code | Completion | Cyclic Expand Word (Backward)_.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    Hold the _⌥_ on macOS or _Alt_ on Windows/Linux key down and keep pressing / until you get to the word you need.
