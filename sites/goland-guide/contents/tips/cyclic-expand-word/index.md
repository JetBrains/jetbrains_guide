    **Cyclic Expand Word** helps you complete any word any from the current
    open files
    
    It's a type of code completion that analyzes your code in the visible scope,
    helps you to complete any word from any of the currently opened files,
    and provides you with suggestions from the current context,
    which can save you plenty of time when, for example,
    you are working on boilerplate code.
    
    **How to use:**

    Press _Alt + / on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + / on macOS_ to search for matching words before the caret or choose _Code | Completion | Cyclic Expand Word_.
    
    Press _Shift + Alt + / on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + ⇧ + / on macOS_ for searching words after the caret or choose _Code | Completion | Cyclic Expand Word (Backward)_.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    Hold the _Alt on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ on macOS_ key down and keep pressing / until you get to the word you need.
