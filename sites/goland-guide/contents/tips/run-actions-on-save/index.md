  If you want to perform tasks on save, you can now use the **Actions on save** feature to reformat the source code, optimize imports, rearrange it, run cleanup, or even upload it to a specified sever.

  **How to use:**

  Turn on the actions you want to perform on save in the _Settings/Preferences | Tools | Actions on Save_ section of the IDE.
