The Recent File window is great, especially with the filter to view only the changed 
files. But it is not enough if we are searching for a specific change or piece of 
code we recently viewed. After all, we can't and shouldn't always remember which 
file a certain part of our code is in.

This is where the Recent Locations popup comes in.

Invoke it using Ctrl+Shift+E and the list of recently viewed files will display not 
only the file name but also the code snippets around the area last viewed in the 
file.

Invoke the same shortcut again and only the changed files will be visible. And the 
best part? Speed Typing works here: you can type in code to filter the results 
further.


Alternatively, use the shortcut but then hold Ctrl, and you will be able to use 
Ctrl+Tab again to move forward through the list of options, or press Shift+Tab and 
move backward.
