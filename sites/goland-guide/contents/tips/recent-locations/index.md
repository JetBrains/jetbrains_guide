    The _Recent File_ tool window is great, especially with the filter to view only the
    changed files. However, it is not enough if we are searching for a specific change
    or piece of code we recently viewed. After all, we can’t and shouldn't always remember
    which file a certain part of our code is in.
    
    This is where the _Recent Locations_ popup comes in.
    
    Invoke it using _Ctrl + Shift + E_ on Windows/Linux, _⌘ + ⇧ + E_ on macOS, and the list
    of recently viewed files will display not only the file name but also the code snippets
    around the area last viewed in the file.
    
    **Pro tip:**
    
    Invoke the same shortcut again, and only the changed files will be visible. The best part?
    _Speed Typing_ works here: you can type in code to filter the results further.
