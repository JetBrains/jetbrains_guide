    GoLand provides code completion suggestions for all modules in the modules 
    cache as you type.
    
    Even if a module has never been imported and used in your project, GoLand is 
    still aware of it and will take care of you.
    
    How to use
    
    Completion will work automatically as you start typing a package name.
