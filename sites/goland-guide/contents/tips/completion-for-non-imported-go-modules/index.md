    GoLand provides code completion suggestions for all modules in the modules 
    cache as you type.
    
    Even if a module has never been imported and used in your project, GoLand is 
    still aware of it and will take care of you.
    
    **How to use:**

    Completion will work automatically as you start typing a package name.
