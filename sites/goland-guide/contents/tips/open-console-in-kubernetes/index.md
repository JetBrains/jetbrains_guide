    **How to use:**

    Select the pod you want from the _Kubernetes_ view in the _Services_ tool window, then click on the _Open Console_ button. A new tab will open and a console will be attached to the running process inside the pod.

    **Note:** You must have the [Kubernetes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10485-kubernetes) provided by JetBrains installed for this action to work.
