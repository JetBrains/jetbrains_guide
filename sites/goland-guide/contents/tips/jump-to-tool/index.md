  *Want a fast way to open IDE tool windows without memorizing 
  shortcuts?*
  
  Get to PyCharm tool windows from the Recent Files popup. Now that you 
  know ``Recent Files``, put it to use for getting  to the tools windows 
  such as ``Project`` and ``Version Control``.

We advocated in previous tips to hide the project tools and use
the keyboard more. But how can get back to our tools?

You could memorize the keyboard shortcut for each tool. But that's
a number of things to jam in the limited real estate of your
memory. Instead, let's get mileage out of something you already
memorized: `Recent Files`.

Use the `Recent Files` action (`Ctrl-E` or `Cmd-E` on macOS)
to open the popup. From there, use your mouse or better yet,
keyboard arrows to select the tool you want to open from the
left column.

Even better, just use speed typing. Type `term` for example to
highlight `Terminal` and press enter. The Terminal appears, with
the focus...just as if you had memorized the keyboard shortcut.
