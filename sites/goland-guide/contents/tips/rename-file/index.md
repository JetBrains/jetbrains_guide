    *Rename files with peace of mind.*

    Changed your name about what you named a file, and now you need to rename
    the test and example files too? Let the IDE handle all this work.
  
    **How to use:**
    
    Invoke the **Rename Refactoring** via _Shift + F6 on Windows/Linux_ or _â‡§ + F6 on macOS_,
    and do the work, safely and quickly.
