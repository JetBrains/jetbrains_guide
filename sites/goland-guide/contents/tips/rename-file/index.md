    *Rename files with peace of mind.*

    Changed your name about what you named a file but terrified of all
    the places it might be used? You might not remember, but the IDE does.
    Let the _Rename Refactoring_, _Shift + F6 on Windows/Linux_ or _â‡§ + F6 on macOS_, do the work, safely and quickly.
