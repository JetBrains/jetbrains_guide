    *Want to select code and remain keyboard-centric?*

    GoLand has actions and keybindings to quickly select code,
    semantically, through scopes and across languages.
     
    _Extend Selection_, with _Ctrl + W on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + Up on macOS_, to semantically select the code.
    
    _Shrink Selection_ with ease using _Ctrl + Shift + W on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + Down on macOS_.
