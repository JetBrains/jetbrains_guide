    **Forward slash (/) lets you browse Space!**
    
    Using Go to Anything (<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> on macOS), search forward slash (`/`) to browse Space hierarchically!
    
    We can navigate to preferences, find chats, projects, repositories. And remember, <kbd>tab</kbd> may let us search within the current context.
