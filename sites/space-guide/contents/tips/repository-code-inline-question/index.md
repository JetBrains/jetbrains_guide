    **Ask questions and discuss code in Git repositories**
    
    Space makes it easy for you and your team to review code, discuss changes, and keep track of accumulated knowledge.
    
    Have a question or want to discuss? Ask it inline! Mention your team or specific colleagues so they get a chat notification.
    
    Those involved can navigate to the code and discuss inline if they ant to, or simply respond from within their chat.
