    **Use keyboard shortcuts to manage checklists efficiently!**
    
    Project checklists help your team manage the project, by setting goals & deliverables. They provide a straightforward list of tracking tasks without much detail, helping with high-level planning. Items can be checked off as soon as they are completed.
    
    While editing checklists, use keyboard shortcuts to create new items, edit existing items, indent & unindent items, and move items around. Checklists are at your fingertips!
    
    Click the `?` icon in a checklist to get an overview of available keyboard shortcuts.
