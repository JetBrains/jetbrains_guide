    **Simplify planning and create issues from a checklist!**
    
    Checklists in Space provide a straightforward list of tracking tasks without much detail. They can be used as a high-level planning tool, or as a daily or weekly to-do list with checkboxes to mark them as completed.
    
    Issues give us a fully functioning issue tracker within the project, and let us specify details about who's assigned, add tags, and keep track of their status. Issues also feature attachments and discussions - a much richer approach to tracking bugs, tasks, features, and so on.
    
    **Do your high-level planning with checklists, then convert items to issues.** Completing a checklist item resolves the issue, and resolving an issue completes the checklist item.
