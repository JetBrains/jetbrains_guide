    Space Chats are the primary place to communicate with your colleagues, and stay up-to-date.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip 2: Common actions in the contact list

Want to pin (or unpin) a channel? Unsubscribe? Enable or disable notifications?

You can do this from the channel settings, and from the contact list.
This is especially useful if you want to quickly perform these actions in multiple channels -- no need to switch channels all the time.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip 4: Collapse Pinned/All chats to one line

In the contact list, you can collapse chats to one line. You can do this for all chats, or just favorite chats.

Use the settings icon, and then **Appearance**, to configure which channels to collapse to one line. As a bonus, you can also show/hide chat tab labels here.
