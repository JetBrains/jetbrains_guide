    **Find messages where you or your team were mentioned**
    
    Using the Mentions tab in Space Chats, you'll find all your personal or team mentions in one place.

    To see your mentions, go to **Chats** and click on **Mentions** at the top of the sidebar. Your team and personal mentions will be stored there. Scroll down a bit to find the older mentions.

    To see the full message where you were mentioned, click on a particular mention, and Space will take you to the corresponding channel, chat, or thread.
