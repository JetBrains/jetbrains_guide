    **Run all the things!**
    
    A `.script.kts` file defines one or more Jobs. Each Job can run one or more Steps. Jobs are triggered by events, such as Git push or when a code review is opened.
           
    Job steps run in an environment, which can be a container, a virtual machine (not yet available) or as a function (not yet available).
    
    In a container, you can run:
    * Shell scripts, using `shellScript { }`
    * Kotlin code, using `kotlinScript { }`
    * Container commands, such as `entrypoint()` and `args()`
    * Language- and framework-specific commands, that can run Gradle, .NET or Docker image builds
