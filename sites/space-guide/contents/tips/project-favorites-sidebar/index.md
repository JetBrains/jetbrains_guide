    **Customize the sidebar &amp; navigate to projects faster!**
    
    Have a project you have to access regularly? Mark it as a favorite so navigating to it from the sidebar becomes easier. Toggle projects and other icons to customize your Space.
    
    Pinned projects show a quick access menu on hover, letting us navigate to the project's issues, checklists and code reviews. Repositories get a direct link, too!
