    **Plan, manage and follow-up on tasks. Organize yourself!**
    
    We can work on our To-Do list and add tasks to it. These To-Do's can be free-format, much like having a personal memo pad. To-Do's can also be entities in Space!
    
    Need to follow up on a chat message? Add it as a To-Do. An issue needs your attention? Add it to the To-Do list.

    Tick off tasks when they are completed. Use the arrow keys to navigate up/down the list, and the space bar to complete an item.
    
    Sometimes, the best way to get something done is to wait for a better time to do it. To-Do's can be postponed until tomorrow, next week, or any time in the future.
    
    The To-Do list is available from the sidebar, and can also be opened using the <kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
