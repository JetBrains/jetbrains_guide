    **Who's around?**
    
    By sharing availability, both present and planned, team members are always informed about whether someone's home sick, planning a vacation, or going on a business trip.
    
    The team calendar helps see who's around, and can be filtered by team, location and role. It helps inform team members about availability, and allows them to adjust their work plans.
