    **Look at packages, versions and details.**
    
    Making use of [Container registries (Docker)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/container-registry.html) or the [Maven repository (Maven, Gradle, SBT)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/maven-repository.html) in Space?
    
    Details about packages can easily be consulted, and contain quick-start information that is easy to copy/paste. For example, we can the copy Gradle configuration from Space, then paste it into `build.gradle` and start using it.
