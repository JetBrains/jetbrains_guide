    **Navigate Space at warp speed!**
    
    Many actions and items can be navigate to with keyboard shortcuts.
    
    At any place, press <kbd>?</kbd> to view available keyboard shortcuts. For navigation, we can press <kbd>G</kbd> (for *Go*), followed by another letter.
    
    Quickly navigate to projects, teams, chats, and more. All of the items in Space are at your fingertips.
    
    Need to navigate to a more specific location, such as a commit or a colleague's profile page? Check the [Go to Anything tips](/space/guide/playlists/go-to-anything-tips/).
