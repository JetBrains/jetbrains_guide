    **Go to Anything - a shortcut to create things!**
    
    With **Go to Anything** (<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> on macOS), we can find our way around Space. But we can also use it to create new things!
    
    **Type `new` and append what you want to create.** Depending on our privileges, we can create absences, articles, projects, meetings, new members and invitations - without the need to context-switch.
    
    Create new things from wherever you are in Space!
