    **Are your tests (good) enough?** ðŸ¤”

    Hot spots help you find complex methods that don't have (much) code coverage.

    By calculating a risk metric, based on code coverage and the complexity of your code, dotCover's hot spots help you pinpoint areas that need more or better test coverage.
