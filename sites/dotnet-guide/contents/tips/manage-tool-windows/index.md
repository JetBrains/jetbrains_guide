    **Too little space to work with?** ü§®

    If you find yourself frequently resizing tool windows like for VCS or the terminal, then you should try one of the following:

    - With the **Undock** view mode a tool window will automatically hide as soon as it loses focus.
    - Using the **Maximize/restore tool window** action will put the active tool window at maximum available space, and will restore to the previous size on the second call.

    Try it now!Ô∏èÔ∏è ü§ì
