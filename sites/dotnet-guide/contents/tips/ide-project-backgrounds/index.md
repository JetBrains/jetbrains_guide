    **Need to express your own personal style?** ðŸ’…

    While Rider comes with many sensible defaults, as developers, we recognize that our IDE can be an extension of our personality. Luckily, for those inclined to customize our development experience,  Rider allows us to set the background on a per-project basis.

    After hitting `Shift+Shift`, we can type **Set Background Image**. From the Background Image dialog, we can select the image and how Rider will tile the image. We can also make the distinction between being the background of the editor and tools, or just the empty frame.

    As a bonus, we can make this setting project-specific, making it clear which projects we are currently working in through visual cues alone.
