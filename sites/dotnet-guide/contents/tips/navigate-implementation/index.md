    Assumptions can lead to painful circumstances. Running unfamiliar libraries can have uncertain results and hours of lost productivity. Have you ever wished you could peek into a black-box codebase?

    Luckily, ReSharper and Rider have developers covered. When using a third-party library, our tools can navigate to a decompiled version of any method. "Navigate to implementation" is a powerful tool in any developer's toolbox â€” clarity and insight into any aspect of your codebase. 

    Knowledge is power!
