    **A better feedback loop!** âš¡

    When saving changes to your code, the test runner automatically runs the tests that are affected by those changes.

    Use dotCover's continuous testing features to increase the feedback loop between writing, compiling, and verifying tests in your test suite.

    Also available in ReSharper and Rider ðŸ’ª
