    **How do these C# 8 features work again?** ðŸ¤”

    Learning new language constructs with Rider is just a matter of hitting **Alt-Enter**. Convert a `switch` statement to `switch` expression? Alt-Enter! Prefer compound assignments instead of simple assignments? Alt-Enter! Make use of `IAsyncDisposable` and `using` declarations? You know what â€“ Alt-Enter! ðŸ™ƒ

    Note that most **quick-fixes can be applied in scopes**, for instance in the current method, type, file, or even for the whole solution.

    Alt-Enter â€“ Probably the most important shortcut ðŸ¤“
