    The ReSharper language engine comes with [over 1500+ code analysis rules, 1900+ code-issue fixes, 58 solution-wide refactorings, and 470+ context actions](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/compare/resharper-vs-visual-studio/).
    And thanks to context-aware inspections, that amount doesn't have to be overwhelming!

    While fixing issues in your code is important, it's even more important to understand why you're making those changes.
    For most inspections, you can use the **"Why is ReSharper suggesting this"** (or **"Why is Rider suggesting this"**) menu to learn about a particular inspection and quick fix.
