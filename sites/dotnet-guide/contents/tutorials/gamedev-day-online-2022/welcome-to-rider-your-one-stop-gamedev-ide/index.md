Rider is a great tool for game development. It can quickly navigate around your project, help you write code faster, and will even find and fix issues as you type. Let’s take a look at Unity and Unreal specific warnings and highlights and how Rider can fix them with a single key press. We’ll learn some important tips and tricks and see how Rider can even show you usages and serialised values from Unity’s assets and Unreal’s Blueprints, directly in the editor!
