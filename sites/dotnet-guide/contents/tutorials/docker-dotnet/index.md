Docker and containerization aren't only about achieving planet-scale applications and pushing the limits of software development. Whether we build small apps or earth-scale, we can find a use for this technology that grows in popularity among developers.

This tutorial aims to inform .NET developers who may have heard about Docker but aren't sure what it is, why they should care, and how it fits into developing their distributed .NET applications.
