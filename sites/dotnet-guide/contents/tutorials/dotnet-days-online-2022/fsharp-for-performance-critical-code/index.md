F# is a language that stretches across many boundaries (web, backend, domain modeling, etc.) and paradigms (functional, imperative, procedural, object-based) while being simple, succinct, and performant.

But there's more to it! In this session, we'll see why F# is also my favorite imperative, procedural programming language when it comes to performance.

We'll explore why chose F# as the language for our new Discrete-Rate Simulation engine, and how we achieved a >100x speedup over other simulation engines in our industry. All with just F# and .NET.
