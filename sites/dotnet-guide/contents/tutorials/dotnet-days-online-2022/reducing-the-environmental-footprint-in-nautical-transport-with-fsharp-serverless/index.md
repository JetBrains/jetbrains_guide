In this talk, I'll walk you through an amazing journey that started more than two years ago. We wanted to use artificial intelligence to predict the most fuel-efficient way to operate a vessel in the North and Baltic Seas, lowering carbon footprint. We were able to develop a robust solution with the right choice of cloud-based services combined with a subtle and effective .NET language. I'm going to show you how all this was possible.
