Remote pairing is a fabulous combination of highly engaging remote development with high people engagement and collaboration. In this live demo, we will take you through a variety of pairing tools and talk about the challenges and successes of remote pairing in each one.

Pairing solves many of the issues inherent in solo development. These include siloed development, lack of domain knowledge, poor mentoring, and insufficient upfront design. Pairing adds collaboration, knowledge sharing, real-time code review, and improved design.

We are going to role-play various dysfunctions with commonly used pairing tools, as well as present our favorite tools and better ways of working.

Whether you are new to pairing or a long-time fan, we have tons of suggestions for how to make the most of remote pairing.
