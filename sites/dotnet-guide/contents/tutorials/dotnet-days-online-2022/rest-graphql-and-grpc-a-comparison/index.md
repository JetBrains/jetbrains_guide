No matter the industry, applications need to talk to each other. So, developers often build bridges – Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) – to allow one system to communicate with another.

Over time, different API architectural styles have been released. Each of them has its own characteristics, patterns of data exchange, pros, and cons. REST, GraphQL and gRPC are three main options when it comes to API development and implementation. In my session, I will cover what REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are, how APIs can be implemented using each of them, and give you a comparison between them.
