Teams that are new to building and maintaining distributed systems with messaging are faced with challenges when it comes to investigating failure scenarios. With messages flowing through the system, it's hard to quickly identify where a failure originates from and why it's occurring. Without a call stack to guide you, we need other techniques to keep a good overview.

In this session, we'll navigate how modeling techniques, integration testing, and instrumentation with OpenTelemetry can help you create visibility for your entire distributed system.
