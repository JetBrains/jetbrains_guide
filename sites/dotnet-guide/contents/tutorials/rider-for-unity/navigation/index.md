Easily find your code, and easily find the assets that are referencing your code!

Rider's rich navigation lets you jump straight to a type, find usages, go to derived or base classes.
The Rider engine indexes your code as well as assets and prefabs. This means that navigating to usages of code can find usages in assets as well.
Invoke **Find Usages** on a `MonoBehaviour` or on a field, and jump straight into the Unity editor.
