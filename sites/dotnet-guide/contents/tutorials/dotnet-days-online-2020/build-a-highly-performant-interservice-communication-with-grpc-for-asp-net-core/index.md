In this session, we introduce gRPC as a modern high-performance RPC framework for ASP.NET Core and for interservice communication. We look at the difference between gRPC and REST-based communication by exploring the pros and cons that these technologies offer; for example, gRPC uses HTTP/2 as base transport protocol and ProtoBuf encoding for efficient and fast communication.

We use F# to build client and server gRPC components defining proto service definition contracts. Next, we will explore tooling for the code-gen to implement the server and client components and how to interop easily with other programming languages. By the end of this session, you will have a practical understanding of how to use gRPC to implement a fast and polyglot system.
