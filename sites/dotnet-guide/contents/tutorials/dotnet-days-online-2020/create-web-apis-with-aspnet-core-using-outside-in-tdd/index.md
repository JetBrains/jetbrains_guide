In this session, I live-code a web API with ASP.NET Core from the business perspective with tests that won't get in the way. Starting from some requirements and the acceptance criteria, I write one acceptance test driving the outer loop of our test suite. I then use it as feedback for the progress of the implementation of the feature until it is completed, using unit tests. This is a technique that I've tried several times within delivery teams in the past, achieving amazing success. AFAIK, this technique was first presented in the book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests" by Steve Freeman and Nat Price.
