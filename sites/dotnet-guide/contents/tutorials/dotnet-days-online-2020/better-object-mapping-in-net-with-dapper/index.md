When people talk about using ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) like Entity Framework or nHibernate in their projects, often they are only looking for one fundamental feature: the ability to map SQL output to a C# object. Large ORM-based solutions add additional complexity, and black-box much of what is happening behind the scenes. 

What if there was a smaller, more efficient way to do object mapping without the overhead of an EF? Dapper to the rescue! Dapper is a micro-ORM whose core function is to reduce some of the ceremony of talking to a SQL database while leaving you in complete control! In this session, we walk through many of the typical use-cases for Dapper and why you might want to consider it for your current or next project.
