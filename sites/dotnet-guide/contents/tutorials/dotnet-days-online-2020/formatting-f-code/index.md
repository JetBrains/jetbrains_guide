If you format F# code in Rider, a tool called Fantomas will be called to process this. Fantomas is open source and I happen to be the maintainer of this project. In this session I'd like to explain how Fantomas's high-level works, how I got involved in this project, and how it is wired into the FSharp support for Rider.
