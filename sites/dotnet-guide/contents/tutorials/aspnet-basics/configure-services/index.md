We'll be focusing on the `ConfigureServices` method and performing registration through the `IServiceCollection` interface.

Throughout this video, We'll see the behavior of our `HelloWorldService` change. We will inject the `HelloWorldService` into a Razor page, and the changes will become clear as we switch between the registration types in `ConfigureServices`.

We'll first register our dependency as `Transient`. The creation of our `HelloWorldService` will occur every time our application asks for an instance. Changing our registration to Scoped will create a single instance for each new web request. Finally, registering a dependency as a `Singleton` will limit our `HelloWorldService` to a single instance for the duration of our application's run.

By changing the registration of our dependencies, we can dramatically alter the behavior in our ASP.NET application.
