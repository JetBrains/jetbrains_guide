We can start a new ASP.NET Core web application from [JetBrains Rider's](https://jetbrains.com/rider) welcome screen. In the .NET Core category, we can utilize the "ASP.NET Core Web Application" template to create a new solution. We need to take careful consideration of the "Type" of our new solution. We can start with either the "Web App" or "Web App (Model View Controller)" project type. With a few clicks, we should have a running ASP.NET Core web application.
