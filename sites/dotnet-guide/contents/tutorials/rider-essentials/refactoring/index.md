### Refactoring your Code

Rider comes with a set of automated, solution-wide code refactorings that let you rename, move, and safely delete symbols;
introduce and inline fields, variables, or parameters, and carry out many more transformations painlessly. Refactorings
are available for most of the supported languages in Rider.

The easiest entry point into refactorings is using the [**Refactor This...**](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Refactor_This.html)
action. It shows all refactorings available in the current context.

Some [refactorings can be applied without invoking any commands](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Refactorings__Inplace_Refactorings.html).
If Rider detects that a code change could be an intention to refactor the code, the **Refactor This** action appears on
the left-hand side of the editor. You can use this action to apply the refactoring solution-wide.
