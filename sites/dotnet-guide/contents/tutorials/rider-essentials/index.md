Join JetBrains .NET developer advocates Rachel, Khalid, Matthias, Matt and Maarten, who will show you their favourite
tips and tricks, uncovering how they work with Rider. We will assume you are already familiar with Rider, and focus on
the essential topics that will help you get more out of the IDE.

Expect navigating through a code base, writing and editing code, inspections, refactoring, a look at debugging, unit testing, and much more.
