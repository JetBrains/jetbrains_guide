### Optimizing Application Performance with Rider

In this tutorial, we used the profiler in Rider to investigate and optimize performance of the [Sudoku solver application](https://github.com/JetBrains/DPA-demo).

There are still some issues remaining, such as excessive allocations of the `Cell` type, which can be solved with
[making `Cell` a `struct`](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/03/31/auto-detect-memory-issues-app-dynamic-program-analysis-rider-2020-1/).
Some small updates of the codebase already greatly improved performance!

Keep in mind that we used Debug builds to analyze the application. Release builds would include compiler optimizations
and provide better performance of our application.

We have seen the different profiling modes in Rider: Sampling, Tracing, Line-by-Line, and Timeline. Sampling or Timeline
profiling have low overhead, and come in handy to do most performance analysis on your application. Tracing and Line-by-Line
provide accurate call numbers, but don't provide reliable call timings.

A good profiling workflow is cyclic: start with a baseline profiling session, make incremental changes, and analyze performance
improvements (or regressions) as you go.

Dynamic Program Analysis (or DPA) analyzes your code automatically, every time it runs. It gives you feedback around memory
usage and allocations, and shows the call stacks where most memory allocation is happening. The Heap Allocations viewer
may help you figure out where hidden allocations and boxing occur in code.
