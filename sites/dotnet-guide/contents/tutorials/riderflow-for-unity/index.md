RiderFlow is a free plugin for the Unity editor that helps you work with your Unity scenes.
Aimed at all types of Unity users, from coders to level designers and artists, RiderFlow will help you organize your scenes,
search for assets and usages, find usages of those assets, quickly move around your scenes, and more.
You can even edit code and refactor your scenes by easily replacing objects in a scene.
