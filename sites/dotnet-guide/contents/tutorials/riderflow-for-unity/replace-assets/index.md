Replace objects refactoring is a unique RiderFlow feature that allows you to quickly replace one or more objects in a scene and automatically update any references.
All scene references to the original objects are also updated in the code.

Select one or more in a scene, right-click and choose **Replace Objects**.
RiderFlow will show you the GameObject chooser popup. From there, it only takes a single click to replace the selected GameObjects with new GameObjects (in the same positions).
All scene references to the original objects are also updated throughout the code.
