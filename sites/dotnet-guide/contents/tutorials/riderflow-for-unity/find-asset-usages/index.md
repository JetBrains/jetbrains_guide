### Find Usages

Use **Find usages** to learn where the asset is used in scenes, other assets, and prefabs.
Right-click on an asset, find usages of that asset in the current scene, and highlight them while everything else is grayed out.

You’ll see a tool window showing where the asset is used in scenes, other assets, and prefabs.
Double-clicking the items will allow you to view their location, and there’s a preview showing the **Inspector** pane.

### Show Usages in Scene

In the project, if you right-click an asset and select **Show Usages in Scene**, RiderFlow will find usages of that asset in the current scene
and visually highlight them while greying out everything else. The results are shown in the Scene view management toolbar and navigating between them is easy.

To stop highlighting usages, press <kbd>Escape</kbd> when the Scene view is focused.
