  The plugin for [JetBrains Space](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/), a new team collaboration tool, is bundled in IntelliJ IDEA. Log in to the team instance to access your projects.

  If you're logged in to Space, you can clone a repo via "Get from VCS", and you can configure where the code is cloned to.

  If you're working with a Space project, you can right click on a commit in the Git log to open it in Space.

  See more tips and tricks for working with Space in our [Space Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/guide/).
