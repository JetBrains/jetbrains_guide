  Instead of typing everything by hand in your build, how about having autocompletion? Let Package Search help! When you add a new dependency, press **^+Space** (macOS) or **Ctrl+Space** (Windows/Linux). The IDE will suggest package names and version numbers. No more typos!
  
  This feature is available for Maven, Gradle Groovy and sbt (for Scala). Gradle Kotlin support is planned, weâ€™ll let you know when it ships!
