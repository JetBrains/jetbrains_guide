IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.1 supports writing, compiling and running #Java17 code
Inspections will show you how to the new use Sealed Classes functionality from #Java17, so you can learn the new features as and when you need to use them
IntelliJ IDEA's inspections help you to use the new features in Java. For example, it can show you places you can use Pattern Matching for instanceof (#Java16), and how to migrate an existing if/else statement to use Pattern Matching for switch (#Java17 preview feature)
IntelliJ IDEA's inspections suggest classes that can be converted to a record (#Java16), and can also change a record into a standard class.
Text Blocks are a great feature from #Java15, they allow us to embed blocks of text or another programming language inside our Java code. If it is another language, you can use Language Injection to get code formatting and suggestions inside this text block.
IntelliJ IDEA can automatically convert switch statements into Switch Expressions (#Java15), which usually leads to more succinct code.
