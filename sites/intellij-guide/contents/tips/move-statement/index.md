  You can use **⇧⌘↑** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow** (Windows/Linux), to move a line up. To move a statement down use **⇧⌘↓** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow** (Windows/Linux).   
  
  **Pro tip:**
  
  This shortcut does factor in scope. You cannot move a statement outside of the scope its contained within.
