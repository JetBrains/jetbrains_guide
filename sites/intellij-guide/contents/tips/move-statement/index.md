  You can use _Shift + Command + Up Arrow_ on macOS, or _Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow_ on Windows/Linux, to move a line up. To move a statement down replace the _Up Arrow_ with _Down Arrow_.   
  
  **Pro tip:**
  
  This shortcut does factor in scope. You cannot move a statement outside of the scope its contained within.
