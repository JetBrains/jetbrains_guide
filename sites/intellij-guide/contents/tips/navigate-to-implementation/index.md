  You can use **⌘B** (macOS), or **Ctrl+B** (Windows/Linux), to navigate to an implementation.
  
  **Pro tip:**
  
  If a method has multiple implementations, IntelliJ IDEA will list them, so you can choose the one that you want. If there is only one implementation, IntelliJ IDEA will take you straight to it.
