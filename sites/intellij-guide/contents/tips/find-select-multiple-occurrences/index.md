  Place your caret on the word or text range you want to find and select multiple occurrences of and then use **⌃G** (macOS), **Alt+J** (Windows/Linux) to find and select the next occurrence of the word. This is a case-sensitive search. You can use **⌃⌘G** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J** to select all matching words in the document rather than selecting one at a time. You can use **⌃⇧G** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+J** (Windows/Linux) to remove the selection from the last selected occurrence. To skip an occurrence, use **⌘G** (macOS), **F3** (Windows/Linux) and to go back to the last selected occurrence, use **⇧⌘G** (macOS), or **Shift+F3** (Windows/Linux).
