  If you want to use preview features in the latest versions of Java in IntelliJ IDEA, you need to set the language level to "Preview". 

  Go to Project Structure, **âŒ˜;** (macOS) or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S** (Windows/Linux), make sure you have the correct JDK selected, and pick the "Preview" option from the Language Level dropdown.
