  Press **â‡§F6** (macOS), or **Shift+F6** (Windows/Linux), to rename anything in IntelliJ IDEA, including interfaces. Everything that uses that interface will also be renamed.
  
  **Pro tip:**
  
  You can use _Option + Shift + O_ on macOS, or _Alt + Shift + O_ on Windows/Linux, to expand the inlay hints to also consider Comments and Text.
