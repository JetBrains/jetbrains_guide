  Press **⇧F6** (macOS), or **Shift+F6** (Windows/Linux), to rename anything in IntelliJ IDEA, including interfaces. Everything that uses that interface will also be renamed.
  
    **Pro tip:**
  
    You can use **⌥⇧O** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+O** (Windows/Linux), to expand the inlay hints to also consider Comments and Text.
