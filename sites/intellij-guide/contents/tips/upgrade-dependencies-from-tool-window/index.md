  Manage your dependencies inside IntelliJ IDEA. From the **Dependency tool window**, we can choose the version to upgrade to by clicking on the version number in the list. Note that we donâ€™t have to use the latest version. We can also automatically upgrade a dependency to the latest version by clicking **Upgrade** for that particular dependency. Or, we can even upgrade all our dependencies at once, by clicking the **Upgrade all** link.
