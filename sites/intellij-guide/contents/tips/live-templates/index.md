  Live Templates reduce the amount of code you need to type for the more common code constructs. You can use _psvm_ or _main_ to create the main Java method, for example. There are lots of live templates including _fori_ for a for i loop and _nn_ for not null, plus many more.
  
  **Pro tip:**
  
  You can also add your own Live Templates, please see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html for more information.
