  IntelliJ IDEA comes with support for [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expressions. You can open up a window to evaluate JSONPath expressions by going to Edit -> Find -> "Evaluate JSONPath Expression...". If a JSON file is open, it will use this file to evaluate the expression.

  If you have JSONPath expressions as Strings in code, use "[inject language](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-language-injections.html)" and say this is a JSONPath expression. You'll get code formatting and completion inside this string.

  You can evaluate a JSONPath expression to check it. This will open up a tool window: enter a snippet of JSON into the input and try out if an expression finds the expected path.
