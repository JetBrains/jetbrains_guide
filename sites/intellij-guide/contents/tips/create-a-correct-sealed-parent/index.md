  Sealed classes (a preview feature in Java 16) are a way to take control of the inheritance hierarchy of our classes. If we have a sealed class like this one, IntelliJ IDEA will tell us we need to "permit" the child class so it can extend this parent. It will also automatically make changes if it can.

  Experiment with Sealed Types, use **⌥⏎** (macOS), or **Alt+Enter** (Windows/Linux) to see and accept suggestions.
