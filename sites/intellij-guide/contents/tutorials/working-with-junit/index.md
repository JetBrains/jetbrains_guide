In this section we will cover two tutorials
- [Migrating JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5](migrating)

This tutorial will cover the configuration changes you need to make (using Maven) to tell IntelliJ IDEA to use Junit 5. We will then step through using IntelliJ IDEA inspections to complete the migration where possible and look at other approaches for more challenging use cases where you cannot perform the migration automatically.

- [Writing Junit 5 Tests](writing)

This tutorial will cover setting up Gradle for use with Junit 5 and some tips and tricks to help you create more readable tests faster using IntelliJ IDEA. This tutorial also talks about how you can work with multiple assertions, bring in data-driven tests, check for exceptions and nest tests with JUnit 5.

*Note: We'll be using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition for all the steps in this tutorial.*
