## Create a New Project
In this tutorial we're going to walk through creating a `Hello World` project with IntelliJ IDEA. We will take a look at how to create and configure that project, creating your Java file and the code for `Hello World`, running your project, and packaging it as a JAR.  

1) You can use the New Project Wizard to create a new Project inside IntelliJ IDEA. From the Welcome screen you can click **New Project** 

### You can use

In this tutorial, we will create, run and package a simple job application that prints hello world to the system output along the way, we'll see intelligent added features for boosting our productivity. For example, coding assistance and supplementary tools. All of these features are available in both intelligent idea, community and intelligent idea.

Ultimate. We can create a new project from the welcome screen by clicking on create new. We want to create a Java project. We need to select a JDK for compiling. This project. Intelligent data shows a list of configured. JDK is at the top and a list of detected JD case. If we've already downloaded one or more to our computer, if we want to use a new daddy, K, we can download one.

Java is packaged and provided by a number of different vendors. This list shows some of the most common ones. Open JDK is Oracle's free, open JDK build, which will always be the latest version. If we pick another vendor, for example, adopt open JDK. Yay. We can see all the available versions, Java 14, since that's the most recent version, but in this tutorial, we're not going to use any new features at all.

This tutorial will work on Java eight or even less. The IDE will spend a bit of time downloading and installing the Java development kit. We need to wait for it to complete before we can continue. We're not going to use any additional libraries or frameworks for this tutorial. So we'll click next. We could create a project from a template, but we're going to do everything from scratch.

We'll call this project. Hello world. We could change the default project location if we wanted to, but I'm going to accept the default.
