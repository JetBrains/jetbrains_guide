## Creating a Dedicated Run Configuration
 
5

We can create a dedicated run configuration. In this tutorial, we've seen how he can use menu items or keyboard shortcuts to do things. We can also press shift twice to use search everywhere. If we don't know the shortcut, we want to create a new run configuration. So let's start typing, edit configurations in search everywhere.

When the correct option appears we can press enter on it. In the wrong configuration dialogue, we can see the run configuration intelligent idea created for running the main method in our head. A world-class. We want to create a new configuration for running the jar file. Let's press the plus button and select jar application.

We'll call this run configuration, hello, world jar. We need to click on the browse button in the path to jar field. We need to find and select our job. Remember, intelligent idea. Put it into out artifacts. Hello world, underscore jar. We can leave everything else at the default values. The last thing we want to do is go down to the before launch section, select the add button here, select build artifacts and choose our hello world dot jar artifact.

This will rebuild the hello world dot jar file. First before we run this configure. Select okay. To save this and select okay. In the wrong configuration dialog to save our new jar run configuration. Now you can see our new hello world jar run configuration is selected by default in the navigation bar.

If we click here, we can see both our hello world class one configuration and our new hello world jar run configuration. Let's run the jar file to see if it works. We get the same output as we did from running the class file, which proves that it works the way we expected.
