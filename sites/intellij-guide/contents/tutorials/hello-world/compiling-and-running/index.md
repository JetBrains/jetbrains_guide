## Compiling and Running the application 

- 3

They can do all of this for you. We can run classes with a main method, either from the green run icon at the class level or from the run icon in the gutter next to the main method itself, we can see there's more than one way to run it. An application. For example, we could debug it, but for this tutorial, we're going to run it in a simplest way.

Intelligent is compiling the file into a class file. And then runs it and shows the output in the run window down at the bottom. The second line in this window is the output of our program. The hello world. We told it to print. The first line shows the command that was used to run the program. We don't usually need to worry about what this was, but it's useful to know in case you want to see exactly what was run and how, for example, we can see this command specifically runs our hello world class.

We can also see exactly which JDK was used, which can be useful if we have multiple versions of Java on the same machine, the last line, which says the process finished with an exit code of zero shows the program ran without error. Let's take a quick look at what happened when we ran the application, intelligent adhere, compiled the hello world.java file into a class file by default, the IDE creates a folder called.

Production code meaning code that isn't test code is put into the production folder. Intelligent idea creates a folder for our hello world project. Then the directory structure for our package. The compiled class file. Hello world dot class can be found at the end of this directory hierarchy.

Intelligent idea also created something called a run configuration for the application we ran. If we want to, we can run or debug any of these run configurations from the navigation bar. If we want to go back to the run window, we can use command and four or ultim four on windows pressing the same keyboard shortcut again, we'll close the run window and put the focus back on the editor.
