In this tutorial you used the [New Project Wizard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-project-wizard.html) to create an IntelliJ IDEA project. You then created a package structure and class called `HelloWorld.java`.

You created a class that printed `Hello World` to the console using both [Live Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html) and [Code Completion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html).

You [ran that project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html) using the [gutter icons](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-gutter-icons.html), and then you used the [Project Structure](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/project-settings-and-structure.html) dialog to [package the application into a JAR file](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiling-applications.html#package_into_jar). 

You then created a new [Run Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) for the JAR file and [ran the application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html) again with the new run configuration.

Finally, you made a change to your `HelloWorld.java` file and tested that change with the [run configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) that you made for your JAR file to check that it was being rebuilt before it was [being run](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-applications.html).
