## Compiling and Running the application 

- Java files like this one can be compiled to bytecode and then run
- IDEA does this by running classes with main method, using green icons in gutter
- Could also debug it
- IDE compiles to a class file and shows output in run window down the bottom
- 1st line shows the command that was used to run the program (which class and which JDK if we have multiple versions)
- 2nd line shows the output of our program
- Final line - exist code 0 ran without error
