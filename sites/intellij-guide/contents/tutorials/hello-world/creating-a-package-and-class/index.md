## IDE Feature Trainer Overview

- IDE has created a new project for our application
- What the project window shows and how to nav it
- Create a new package and class for our application
- Packages group classes that belong to the same category or provide similar functionality 
- Keyboard shortcuts to create a new class in SRC directory and select Java class
- Type the whole package path with dots and then the class name and it will do it for us (both package and class)
- See the HelloWorld.java file and created package statement and class declaration
- Shift + Enter to go to the next line with caret in correct place
- For Java main method type "main" and mention this is a live template, press Enter
- PSVM generated with correct parameters - can save a lot of typing 
- Cmd+J/Ctrl J to see all live templates valid for current context, then press Escape
- Call a method that prints method to the output. Mention live templates but look at code completion
- Instead use code completion, type in "Sy" and see that System is displayed
- Press Ctrl + dot and see that System. is auto completed
- Type "o" for accessible fields and methods that start with "o" and those that contain after it. Ctrl + dot again
- Code completion shows the most likely methods, can just press enter if it's at the top
- IDEA shows all teh param types avaiable
- When we type double quote, we get a closing quote from the editor. It also highlights a string param so can see it's a valid type, press escape to hide it
- Type in Hello World, congratulations!
