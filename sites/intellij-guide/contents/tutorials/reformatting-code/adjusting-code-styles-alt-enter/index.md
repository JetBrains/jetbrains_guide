## Adjust Code Style Settings with Intention Actions (Alt + Enter)

Must highlight code for this to work. 

_For example, if we want for loops to also have curly braces, we can highlight an example of the code we want to change the formatting of, and press Alt+Enter._

_Then we select “Adjust code style settings”.  IntelliJ IDEA will show just the settings that apply to this bit of code. We can experiment with these settings and see the changes previewed live in our code. Under the “Wrapping and Braces” tab, under “‘for()’ statement” we can set “Force braces” to “true” always to have IntelliJ IDEA insert curly braces around the body of our for loop. When we save these changes, they will be saved to our current Code Style scheme._
