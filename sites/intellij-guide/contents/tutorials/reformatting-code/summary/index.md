## Summary
In this tutorial we have looked at how to apply the [code style settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html) in a number of different scenarios including on a per-class basis and before-commit, as well as only reformatting code that you've changed. We've also looked at how to integrate [EditorConfig files](https://editorconfig.org/) into your project and pulled it all together with an example. 

You can also take a look at our [IntelliJ IDEA Blog and embedded video on Code Formatting](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/06/code-formatting/).
