## Summary and Resources
In this project we used the New Project Wizard in IntelliJ IDEA to create a Spring Boot project with the **Spring Web** dependency. We created a Spring Controller and served some text to the local Tomcat webserver. Finally, we added a test for our HTTP call.  

### Resources
I followed [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to create this tutorial.
  
The New Project Wizard in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate uses [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). to create the project behind the scenes. 

There are lots of [excellent guides](https://spring.io/guides) available on the Spring website that you can also have a play with. I strongly recommend you work through more of them, especially if you're interested in Spring development and learning more.

You can [read more about Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and the project is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).
