## Summary and Resources
In this project we used the New Project Wizard in IntelliJ IDEA to create a Spring Boot project with the **Spring Web** dependency. We created a Spring Controller and served some text to the local Tomcat webserver. Finally, we added a test for our HTTP call.  

### Resources
I followed the guide here to create this tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/. The New Project Wizard in IntelliJ IDEA uses Spring Initializr to create the project behind the scenes. You can read more about that here: https://start.spring.io/.

There are lots of excellent guides available on the Spring website that you can also have a play with: https://spring.io/guides. I strongly recommend you work through more of them, especially if you're interested in Spring development and learning more.

You can read more about Spring Boot specifically here: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot and the project is also available on GitHub here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot.
