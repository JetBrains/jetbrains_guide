## Using [IntelliJ IDEA Inspections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html#access-inspections-and-settings) to Migrate All Tests
- Enabling the _JUnit 4 can be JUnit 5_ inspection (available from Java 8 with the dependencies from the previous step set up)
- Using this IntelliJ IDEA inspection to migrate JUnit 4 Tests
- Understanding the [Refactoring Preview window](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/refactoring-source-code.html#refactoring_preview)
- Refactor JUnit 4 tests in one class to JUnit 5 and understand how they are mapped and run
- Rerunning the tests and verifying that the JUnit 5 tests are performing the same function as they were with JUnit 4
