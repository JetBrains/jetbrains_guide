In this tutorial we're going to use the Spock framework to create and run unit tests.

We'll create a new project that contains Java code, and use [Spock](https://spockframework.org/) to unit test that code. Although Spock tests are written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/), we can use this framework to test [Java](../../../technologies/java/) production code. 

Spock tests can be easy to read, and so this framework can be used not only to test application code, but also to document its expected behaviour.
