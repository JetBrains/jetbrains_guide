Let's say we want to query the database for all employees that have a space in their last name.

**Exercise**: Take a few minutes to write the code to find and print all employees with space in their last name. 

Done? Here is what that would look like:
```java
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner run(EmployeeRepository repository) {
    return (args) -> {
        System.out.println(repository.findEmployeesByLastNameContaining(" "));
    };
}
```

## End Result
If you inserted the same data mentioned in the tutorial, you should the `Dalia` employee in the console output:
