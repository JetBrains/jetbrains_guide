## Setting an abbreviation

You may have noticed that there are a lot of results when we type Gradle into any of the search options. We may want to provide a way to quickly access the Gradle tool window.

You can, of course, set a keyboard shortcut for any IntelliJ IDEA action, and you may want to set one for opening the Gradle tool window. Press Enter with the Gradle Tool Window item selected, and choose Add Keyboard Shortcut.

Alternatively, or even additionally, from here we could select "Add Abbreviation". Here we can provide a short, memorable text string which we can use when searching for the Gradle tool window. For example, enter "grdl" and press Enter, or OK.

Now, if we bring up the search everywhere dialog by pressing Shift twice, if we type grdl we'll see the Gradle Tool Window as the first result, it's not hiding in a list of similar looking results.
