You may have noticed that there are a lot of results when we type "Gradle" into any of the search options. We may want to provide a way to quickly access the Gradle tool window.

You can, of course, [set a keyboard shortcut](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html#add-keyboard-shortcut) for any IntelliJ IDEA action, and you may want to set one for opening the Gradle tool window. 

Alternatively, or even additionally, we can [add an abbreviation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html#add-abbreviation). 

On the Keymap page of the Settings/Preferences dialog, **âŒ˜,** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+S**  (Windows/Linux), right-click an action and select **Add Abbreviation**.

We can provide a short, memorable text string which we can use when searching for the Gradle tool window. For example, enter "grdl" and press **Enter**, or **OK**.

Now, if we bring up the Search Everywhere dialog by pressing **Shift** twice, and we type "grdl" we'll see the Gradle Tool Window as the first result, it's not hiding in a list of similar looking results.
