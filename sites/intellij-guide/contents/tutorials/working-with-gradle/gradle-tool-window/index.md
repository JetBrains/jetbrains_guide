## The Gradle tool window
The Gradle Tool Window is a very useful way to work with Gradle in IntelliJ IDEA. Let's look at a number of different ways to get to it.

IntelliJ IDEA usually provides lots of different ways to navigate to something we need. To open the Gradle tool window we can:

Click on the quick access button in the bottom left, and click Gradle.
Or, if you have the Tool Window Bars open, you can click on the Gradle button.
The Recent Files dialog, which we can open with Cmd E or Ctrl E, also shows a list of all the tool windows, so we can either move down to this using the mouse or using the arrow keys, or we can start typing "Gradle" to go straight to it.
You can also use Find Action, Cmd Shift A or Ctrl Shift A, and type Gradle, or Search Everywhere by pressing Shift twice.

You may have noticed that there are a lot of results when we type Gradle into any of the search options. The next step walks through a tip for dealing with this.
