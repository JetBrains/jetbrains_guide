In this tutorial we saw an overview of the support for Gradle projects in IntelliJ IDEA, and some tips for working effectively with them.

Some helpful shortcuts mentioned in the tutorial and video:

 - **⇧⌘I** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+O** (Windows/Linux) - load Gradle changes
 - **⌘N** (macOS) or **Alt+Insert** (Windows/Linux) - use in the `build.gradle` file to add a new dependency
 - **⇧⇧** (macOS), or **Shift+Shift** (Windows/Linux) - [Search everywhere](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/searching-everywhere.html) - we can use this to open the Gradle Tool Window
 - **⌘⇧A** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+A** (Windows/Linux) - find action, you can use this to open the Gradle Tool Window
- **⌘E** (macOS), or **Ctrl+E** (Windows/Linux) - recent files, and it also lists all the tool windows, so it's an easy way to get to the Gradle window
- **⌃⌃** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Ctrl**  (Windows/Linux) - [Run anything](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-anything.html), you can even run Gradle commands from here
- **⌘,** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+S**  (Windows/Linux) - open [Preferences/Settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-preferences-dialog.html) dialog
