## Moving Statements Up or Down

In the editor, place the caret in the statement you want to move and press **⇧⌘↑** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+Up** (Windows/Linux) to move a statement up. Alternatively, use **⇧⌘↓** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+Down** (Windows/Linux) to move a statement down. 

IntelliJ IDEA will not let you move a statement outside its scope.
