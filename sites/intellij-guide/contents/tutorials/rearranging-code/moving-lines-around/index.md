## Moving Content Up or Down in Your Class
With your caret on a line, you can press **⌥⇧↑** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+Up Arrow** (Windows/Linux), to move a line up. Alternatively, you can move a line down with **⌥⇧↓** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+Down Arrow** (Windows/Linux). The same shortcut can move a selection up or down.
