## Moving a Line Up or Down
With your caret on a line, you can press **⌥⇧↑** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+Up Arrow** (Windows/Linux), to move a line up. Alternatively, you can move a line down with **⌥⇧↓** (macOS), or **Alt+Shift+Down Arrow** (Windows/Linux). The same shortcut can move a selection up or down. 

This does not account for scope. That means you can easily break your code by moving a statement outside its scope!
