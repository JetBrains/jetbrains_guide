In this tutorial we’re going to look at features of JUnit 5 that can make it easier for us to write effective and readable automated tests.

## Top shortcuts
This blog post includes some shortcuts, but many more were demonstrated in the video and not all of them were mentioned here:

`⌘[ or Ctrl+Alt+left arrow` to navigate back – makes it easy to navigate between all the places you’ve been while writing code and running tests

`⌘[ or Ctrl+Alt+left arrow` to navigate back – makes it easy to navigate between all the places you’ve been while writing code and running tests

`⌘⇧T or Ctrl+Shift+T` to navigate between test and test subject. This is explored in the Top 5 Navigation Tips (blog and video).

`⌃⇧J or Ctrl+Shift+J` to join Lines to create compiling code.

`⇧⌘⏎ or Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to complete Statement close off the brackets and statement, and it also formats the code too.

`⌃⇧Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space` to use smart completion
