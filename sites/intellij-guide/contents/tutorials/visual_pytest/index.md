Python developers love writing code. Tests? Not so much. Whether itâ€™s the
concepts of testing, or the interface of testing tools, testing is a chasm
not all developers cross.

This tutorial aims to bring Python testing to the masses, taking a new
approach to first contact with Python testing:

- Let's make it fun and valuable

- Visual testing using PyCharm

- Driven by the popular [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

- Real-world scenario during the live building of a simple Python application

- Shows how PyCharm can help you get into testing and development "flow"

*Note: We'll be using PyCharm Community Edition for all the steps in this tutorial.*
