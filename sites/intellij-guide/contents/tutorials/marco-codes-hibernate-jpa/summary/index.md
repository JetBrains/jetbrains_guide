## Further Reading
This video-tutorial is a crash course into the Hibernate & JPA universe.  We'll start with getting the correct project dependencies, annotating our classes with JPA annotations and setting up a SessionFactory. This allows us to execute basic CRUD operations, HQL and Criteria queries. Afterwards we can simply JPAify our code, switching out a couple of classes and you'll understand how Hibernate / JPA & Spring Boot play together. By the end of it, you'll have a good (initial) understanding of how to use it and what your future Hibernate / JPA learning journey entails.
