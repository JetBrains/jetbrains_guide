We recommend using shortcuts as much as possible when presenting. This is easier to do during a presentation than using a mouse or trackpad, especially if you get nervous and your hands might get slippery. There are several ways to learn shortcuts.

* **Find Action** lets you search for commands and settings across all menus and tools.
* [Key Promoter X](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x) is a plugin that shows a popup notification with the corresponding keyboard shortcut whenever a command is executed using the mouse. It also suggests creating a shortcut for commands that are executed frequently.
* If you are using one of the predefined keymaps, you can print the [default keymap reference card](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf) and keep it on your desk to consult it if necessary. This cheat sheet is also available under **Help > Keyboard Shortcuts PDF**.
* To print a non-default or customized keymap, use the [Keymap exporter plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7066-keymap-exporter).

Let's take a look at some shortcuts for navigation.
