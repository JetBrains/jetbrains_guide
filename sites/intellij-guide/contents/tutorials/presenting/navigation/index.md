We can use several shortcuts to navigate around a project:

We can **Find a class** using **⌘ O** (on Mac) or **Ctrl+N** (on Windows/Linux).

We can also navigate backwards by using **⌘ \[** (on Mac) or **Ctrl+Alt+Left** (on Windows/Linux), or navigate forward: **⌘ ]** (on Mac) or **Ctrl+Alt+Right** (on Windows/Linux).

Use **⇧ ⌘ E** (on Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+E** (on Windows/Linux) to find **Recent Locations**.
