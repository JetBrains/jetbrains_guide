Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

IntelliJ IDEA [integrates seamlessly with Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html), applying project settings from the build file and delegating build and test tasks to Maven where appropriate.
