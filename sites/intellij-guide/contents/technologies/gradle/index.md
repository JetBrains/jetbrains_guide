IntelliJ IDEA [integrates seamlessly with Gradle](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html), applying project settings from the build file and delegating build and test tasks to Gradle where appropriate.

Gradle build scripts are written using a Groovy or Kotlin DSL, and IntelliJ IDEA provides code completion and generation within the build file.
