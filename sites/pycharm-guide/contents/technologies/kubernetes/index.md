Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system
for automating deployment, scaling, and management of 
containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into
logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes
builds upon 15 years of experience of running production 
workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas
and practices from the community.
