Want to quickly find a choice in a long list? Whether it's a file in the
project tool, a symbol in `Find Symbol`, an action in `Search Everywhere`,
or a choice in `File | New`, speed search makes it fast and simple...without
using the mouse.

Filter by:

- Typing a letter, causing the list to narrow

- Typing another letter...if you now match only one choice, it's selected
and you can press enter

- Press space and type the letter of another word in the option

- Use punctuation such as forward-slash to mean directory separator and
period to mean file extension
