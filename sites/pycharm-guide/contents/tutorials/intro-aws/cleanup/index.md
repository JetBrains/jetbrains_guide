In this tutorial step, we will be removing all the services used during the tutorial.

* *If you are already aware how to remove resources from AWS then you can skip it.* (Optional)

# Cleanup

We will navigate to **CloudFormation** dashboard from AWS Management Console. 

Next, we will delete **ServerlessDemoStack** which indeed 
going to remove ( Lambda functions, API Gateway, Authorizers) etc. 

But it's not going to remove the S3 Bucket. So, we have to remove it manually. I will be navigating to Amazon S3 and open the bucket **serverless-pycharm-demo**.
First, I need to remove the existing objects otherwise it wonâ€™t allow me to delete the bucket. 


Once the objects have been deleted successfully then we can proceed forward to delete the bucket.
