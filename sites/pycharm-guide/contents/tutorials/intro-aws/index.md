AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
 Is it similar when it comes to PyCharm which helps developers to build, ship and 
 deploy serverless functions.

This  tutorial helps on understanding how we can easily
 write serverless functions and easily deploy through PyCharm.


*Note: We'll be using PyCharm Professional Edition for all the steps in this tutorial, 
we will also be using MongoDB database as our primary datastore for that we will be
relying on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).*
