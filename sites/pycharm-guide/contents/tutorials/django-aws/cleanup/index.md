Hello everyone, welcome to the Django tutorial series. In this final tutorial step, we are going to remove the 
AWS resources that we created during this tutorial. 

We are going to remove DB instance, EC2 server, ECR repository, DjangoVPC, IAM User and 
finally cancel our NICE DCV subscription from AWS marketplace.

I recommend watching the video because it is self-explanatory. If you are already aware of how to do this, then you can skip this video.
