Interested in running your entire application in AWS and feel like working in the local machine, then you
are at the right place. This tutorial helps to understand how we can easily run, test, build and finally deploy our 
application through PyCharm using [NICE DCV](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/), which is a high-performance remote display
protocol that provides customers with a secure way to deliver remote desktops and
application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device.

This is just the beginning, and we are going to explore a lot of cool stuffs.

* Working with AWS RDS
* Integrating Sentry
* Securing APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Playing with BDD Tests & lots more to come.


*Note: We'll be using PyCharm Professional Edition for all the steps in this tutorial.*
