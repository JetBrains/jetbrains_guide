[NICE DCV](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/) is a high-performance remote display
protocol that provides customers with a secure way to deliver remote desktops and
application streaming from any cloud or data center to any device, over varying
network conditions. With NICE DCV and Amazon EC2, customers can run graphics-intensive
applications remotely on EC2 instances, and stream their user interface to simpler client
machines, eliminating the need for expensive dedicated workstations.

*Note: We'll be using PyCharm Professional Edition for all the steps in this tutorial.*
