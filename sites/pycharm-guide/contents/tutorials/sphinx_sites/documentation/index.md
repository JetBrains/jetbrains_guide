This tutorial is about using Sphinx for more than documentation.
Sometimes, though, you want code -- inside your website.
You can still do that when using Sphinx and Markdown, and the combination has both some treats and pitfalls.
Let's take a look.

## Code In A Document

It is quite common in Markdown to just embed a code snippet in a page.
Markdown calls these "fenced code blocks" (or code fences, or code blocks) as they use a triple backtick enclosing symbol.

Sphinx has a concept of [code-blocks](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block).
Thanks to MyST, we can combine these two and use *Markdown code fences* (triple backticks) to generate *Sphinx code blocks*:

~~~
```
def hello(name):
   return f'Hello {name}'
```
~~~

This renders with syntax highlighting:

Of course you might want to tell Sphinx what language is the code block, to get the correct syntax highlighting.
Sphinx uses [Pygments](https://pygments.org) for syntax highlighting, with `python3` is the default.
But perhaps you want to show a *JavaScript* snippet.
Just put the language after the first triple-backtick, from the [list of languages supported by Pygments](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/):

~~~
```javascript
 function hello(msg) {return `Hello ${msg}`}
```
~~~

Sphinx has a number of [options for code blocks](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block).
This requires, though, a [more explicit MyST syntax](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/syntax-optional.html) that connects into code blocks:

~~~
```{code-block} javascript
 function hello(msg) {
   return `Hello ${msg}`
 }
```
~~~

As mentioned in [More Pages](../more_authoring/), this is a code fence, but with:

- Something in curly braces and...
- Something else after it.

The stuff in the curly braces maps directly to a Sphinx/reST [directive](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html).
The stuff on the same line, but after the curly braces, is an *argument* to that directive.

You can show line numbers by passing *options* to the directive:

~~~
```{code-block} javascript
:linenos:
 function hello(msg) {
   return `Hello ${msg}`
 }
```
~~~

Here is the YAML version of passing the arguments to the `code-block` directive:

~~~
```{code-block} javascript
---
linenos: true
---
 function hello(msg) {
   return `Hello ${msg}`
 }
```
~~~

You can emphasize certain lines:

~~~
```{code-block} javascript
---
linenos: true
emphasize-lines: 2
---
 function hello(msg) {
   return `Hello ${msg}`
 }
```
~~~

When rendered, you get a highlighted line and line numbers:

Sphinx code blocks have [many useful options](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block).

## Including Code From a File

Inlining code snippets seems to be the dominant usage in Markdown.
In Sphinx, though, it is more common to point your document at a *file* containing the code, then including the file's contents.
Sphinx uses the [literalinclude](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-literalinclude) directive for this.

Thanks to MyST, we also have a Markdown-friendly syntax for this, similar to what we just saw.
Imagine we have a Python module `my_demo.py` in the same directory as a Markdown file.

```
class MyDemo:
    """ A *great* demo """
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def hello(self):
        """ Be friendly """
        return f"Hello {self.name}"
```

We can directly include it, with syntax highlighting, using:

~~~
```{literalinclude} my_demo.py
```
~~~

Sphinx's `literalinclude` has a number of options, many overlapping with `code-block`.
Want to highlight two lines?

~~~
```{literalinclude} my_demo.py
:emphasize-lines: 2-3
```
~~~


You can also use MyST's [YAML syntax for directive options](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/directive.html?highlight=yaml#module-myst_parser.parse_directives) instead of the RST-style of key-value pairs:

~~~
```{literalinclude} my_demo.py
---
emphasize-lines: 2-3
---
```
~~~

The `literalinclude` options in Sphinx are quite powerful and productive to use.
For example, you can use `start-after` and `end-before` to only include parts in between some matching text.

## Configuring `autodoc`

Sure, this tutorial is about using Sphinx for websites, instead of docs.
But the line between the two is thin.
Perhaps you want a full-featured "knowledge base" website oriented around code.
(Yep, me too.)

This brings up the centerpiece of the Sphinx ecosystem: [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html).
With Autodoc, you point a Sphinx doc at your code and it generates a structured, highlighted, interlinked collection of sections.
Even better, the symbols in your code become "roles" in Sphinx which you can directly to.

Let us setup `autodoc` for use in a MyST-powered website.
First, in our `conf.py`, include the `autodoc` extension.
Also, add the current directory to the front of our `PYTHONPATH`, so our module can be imported.

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("."))

extensions = [
    "myst_parser",
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
]
```

With this in place, you can use `autodoc` *directives* in your Sphinx pages.

## Documenting a Module

Let's do that now.
We have a page at `api.md` into which we'd like to include some module documentation.
The [Sphinx docs on `autodoc`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#directives) show that this is straightforward.
For the MyST side, we need to use the escape hatch into reStructuredText directives, as explained in the [MyST How To](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/howto.html?highlight=autodoc#use-sphinx-ext-autodoc-in-markdown-files):

~~~
# About `MyDemo`

Let's take a look at this Python class.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: my_demo.MyDemo
  :members:
```
~~~

In this example, documentation for the `MyDemo` class will be inserted into the `api` page.
Here's what the rendered output looks like:

![API](api.png)

It's very rich output, with lots of links generated to imports, symbols, etc.
We can actually do better, with richer formatting in docstrings and type hints.

## Docstrings and Type Hints

Our `my_demo.MyClass` has a minimal docstring and does not use type hints for parameters and return values.
Let's change it to be a better-documented class:

```python
class MyDemo:
    """ A *great* demo """
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def hello(self, greeting: str) -> str:
        """ The canonical hello world example.

        A *longer* description with some **RST**.

        Args:
            name: The person to say hello to.
        Returns:
            str: The greeting
         """
        return f"{greeting} {self.name}"
```

Python docstrings are reStructuredText, but don't have any conventions about the structure.
For this, [NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) and [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments) have popular style guides for Python docstrings.
For these, the [Napolean extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) (bundled with Sphinx) can support either.

The updated `MyClass` is  using the Google docstring style.
It also uses Python 3.6+ type hints.
We now need to teach Sphinx to "interpret" these two new structures: formatted docstrings and type hints.

First, install `autodoc` extension package that teaches `autodoc` to handle type hints.
Add `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` to `requirements.txt`:

```
sphinx
livereload
myst-parser
sphinx-autodoc-typehints
```

Then install from the requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, edit your `conf.py` file to enable both Sphinx extensions:

```
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
    "sphinx.ext.napoleon",
    "sphinx_autodoc_typehints",
    # And any other extension
]
```
*Note: Make sure to load `sphinx.ext.napoleon` before `sphinx_autodoc_typehints`.*
When Sphinx renders the next time, our page with the `autodoc` directive now shows nice docstrings and type hints:

![Autodoc With Napoleon](autodoc_with_napoleon.png)

It's visually attractive.
More than that, though...it's semantically rich: links to navigate around, styling for the structure, and more.

More?

## Referencing Symbols in Docs

As with other things in Sphinx, `autodoc` isn't just about getting pretty pixels on the page.
It's really about getting *structure* into Sphinx's "doctree".
With `autodoc`, the symbols in your code become *roles* that we can link to.

To see it in action, open `about_us.md` for editing.
In this page, we want to talk about `MyClass` and link to it, using Markdown-friendly syntax.

For example, we can use MyST "extended Markdown" syntax:

```markdown
As we can see in [our Python class](my_demo.MyDemo), Python is fun!
```

This generates a paragraph with a link.

We can also use role-based syntax, with the [Python domain](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html) as a prefix:
This comes with an extra benefit, as link text is provided for you:

```markdown
As we can see in {py:class}`my_demo.MyDemo`, Python is fun!
```

The link text comes from the target.
Of course, we can also provide our own link text:

```markdown
As we can see in {py:class}`HW <my_demo.MyDemo>`, Python is fun!
```

## Conclusion

There are lots, *lots* more features regarding Sphinx and including source code:

- Directive options with fine-tuned control...after all, it is used for Python itself.
- Plugins which add extra features, such as the type hinting plugin.
- Importantly, central concepts that provide a lot of semantic structure.

If you have a website that is also about code, Sphinx and Markdown are a good choice.
