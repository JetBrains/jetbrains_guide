# Static Sites With Sphinx and Markdown

Everybody knows Sphinx for documenting project, Python and otherwise.
But not everybody thinks of Sphinx for the rest of a site.
With the arrival of full Markdown support via MyST, and with static site generators having a renaissance, it's time to give Sphinx a second look.

This tutorial shows authoring Sphinx sites using Markdown and what it has to offer versus other approaches.

## Audience

- Existing Sphinx users that aren't yet using Markdown via MyST

- Sphinx documentation writers interesting in site building beyond just docs

- Static site users who aren't using Sphinx and don't know what they're missing

## Goals

- Quickly get oriented with Sphinx for static sites, beyond just documentation

- Show how easy it is to switch to Markdown, and what kind of power you then get

- Cover Sphinx's "special sauce": the data model of doctrees and references that change "pile of pages" into an interconnected site
