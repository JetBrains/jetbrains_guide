Schlockchain has a website, with content, structure, and linking.
But it looks....bland.
Let's spice things up with a custom look by making new [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates.

## Hello World Page Layout

To make things clear, we're not making a [Sphinx theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/theming.html) which implies a bunch of contracts for re-use.
We're the only ones using this layout.
We don't need to make it configurable.

To start, we're going to replace the template for "pages" by writing a specially-named file `_templates/page.html`:

```
<h2>Hello</h2>
```

All the pages on our site certainly look different now:

![Page Hello](page_hello.png)

We've replaced the [`page.html` template used Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/master/sphinx/themes/basic/page.html) template with something static.
It's used on every "page" in the site, although Sphinx also has other kinds of pages with specially-named `_templates` files to override:

- about
- donate
- layout
- navigation
- relations
- support

Before getting into the intricacies of injecting content, let's put in a nice look-and-feel.

## Bulma Layout

I'm a big fan of the [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io).
It's like Bootstrap, but a bit lighter, though less popular.
Let's add [the starter with CSS from CDN](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/#starter-template) to make our site look better:
It's simplified (no SCSS customizing, no figure support) but it's fine for this tutorial.

Add a file at `_templates/layout.html`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Hello Bulma!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.2/css/bulma.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="title">
        Hello World
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        My first website with <strong>Bulma</strong>!
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

With our look-and-feel started, we can now add the content structure to the template.

## Dynamic Page

Although the file has a `.html` suffix, because it is in the magically-named `_templates` directory, it's actually a Jinja2 template.
This means it can use the [template variables available in Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/templating.html#global-variables).

First, let's get the page title into the HTML `<title>`:

```
<title>{{ title|striptags|e }}{{ titlesuffix }}</title>
```

Let's gradually build up a [Bulma navbar](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/), starting with the configured logo as the [navbar brand](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#navbar-brand).
Add the following just after the opening of `<body>`:

```
<nav class="navbar" role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation">
    <div class="navbar-brand">
        <a class="navbar-item" href="https://bulma.io">
            <img alt="Logo" src="{{ pathto('_static/' + logo, 1)}}" width="102" height="28">
        </a>
    </div>
</nav>
```

We now have the start of a navbar, with a logo that is a clickable-link to the home page:

![Navbar Brand](navbar_brand.png)

Next, we'll add a simple [navbar start](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#navbar-start-and-navbar-end) for some links, just after the close of the `<div>` in the `<nav>`.
We also add a navbar end for the searchbox.
The `<nav>` now has two `<div>` elements as children:

```
<div class="navbar-menu">
    <div class="navbar-start">
        <a class="navbar-item" href="{{ pathto(master_doc) }}">Home</a>
        <a class="navbar-item" href="{{ pathto('about_us') }}">About</a>
    </div>
    <div class="navbar-end">
        <a class="navbar-item">
            <form class="search" action="{{ pathto('search') }}" method="get">
                <input class="input is-rounded " type="text" placeholder="Search..." name="q"
                       aria-labelledby="searchlabel"/>
            </form>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```

We aren't really showing the document content.
Let's replace the `<section>` with a `<main>` element that supplies the content:

```
<main class="section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content" role="main">
            {{ body }}
        </div>
    </div>
</main>
```

We've forgotten about copyright.
Let's add a `<footer>` to display it, just before `</body>`:

```
<footer class="footer">
    <div class="content has-text-centered">
        <p>
            <strong>Our Site</strong> by <a href="https://example.com">Schlockchain</a>.
            Copyright Â© {{ copyright }}
        </p>
    </div>
</footer>
```

We now have the structure of a page:

![Page Structure](page_structure.png)

## Layout CSS

It's easy to spot a problem, though: we have a strange paragraph symbol after the heading.
We need to add a link to our custom CSS, then in there, add some styling to hide that symbol except on hover.

First, add a `<link>` to the end of the `<head>`, after the link to the Bulma CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ pathto('_static/pygments.css', 1) }}">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ pathto('_static/custom.css', 1) }}">
```

The first line will get us the styling for code on the `about_us` page.
Next, open `_static/custom.css_t`, remove the contents, and add the following:

```css
a.headerlink {
    visibility: hidden;
}

a.brackets:before,
span.brackets > a:before{
    content: "[";
}

a.brackets:after,
span.brackets > a:after {
    content: "]";
}

h1:hover > a.headerlink,
h2:hover > a.headerlink,
h3:hover > a.headerlink,
h4:hover > a.headerlink,
h5:hover > a.headerlink,
h6:hover > a.headerlink,
dt:hover > a.headerlink,
caption:hover > a.headerlink,
p.caption:hover > a.headerlink,
div.code-block-caption:hover > a.headerlink {
    visibility: visible;
}
```

You might need to do a force-reload in the browser to see the change.
Now, when you hover on `Schlockchain Homepage`, you see the paragraph symbol.
Also, if you click on `About`, you'll see that our code is syntax-highlighted.

## Layout Template

We're going to need a page for search results.
Sphinx already provides one, but it won't use our new look.
We thus need to refactor `page.html` into a `layout.html` Jinja2 [base template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/).

First, rename `page.html` to a new file `_static/layout.html`, then change the `<main>` block:

```
<main class="section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content" role="main">
            {% block body %}
            {% endblock %}
        </div>
    </div>
</main>
```

While this is mostly the same, we defined a `body` block that child templates can fill.
We can now create `_static/page.html` which uses that base template and puts content into the block:

```
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
{{ body }}
{% endblock %}
```

Everything should look the same.

## Layout JS

Alas, our search box doesn't really work.
Pressing enter goes the page, but it's empty:

![Broken Search](broken_search.png)

We need to do two things: get some JavaScript loaded, and make a custom search results page which inserts the results.
We'll start with the first part.
Add the following in the `<head>`:

```
{%- for js in script_files %}
    {{ js_tag(js) }}
{%- endfor %}
<script id="documentation_options" data-url_root="{{ url_root }}"
        src="{{ pathto('_static/documentation_options.js', 1) }}"></script>
<script src="{{ pathto('_static/searchtools.js', 1) }}"></script>
<script src="{{ pathto('_static/language_data.js', 1) }}"></script>
<script src="{{ pathto('searchindex.js', 1) }}" defer></script>
```

We've taken the lazy approach.
Ideally, we should load this at the end of `<body>`.
Or even better, define a block that we can fill from the search results page, leaving only the parts needed on all the pages.
But this is ok for this tutorial.

Next, make a template at `_templates/search.html` for the search page:

```
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %}
{% if search_performed %}
<h2>Search Results</h2>
{% if not search_results %}
<p>Your search did not match any documents. Please make sure
    that all words are spelled correctly and that you've selected
    enough categories.</p>
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
<div id="search-results">
    {% if search_results %}
    <ul>
        {% for href, caption, context in search_results %}
        <li><a href="{{ pathto(item.href) }}">{{ caption }}</a>
            <div class="context">{{ context|e }}</div>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

This new search results page gives us our layout and fills in the block for results.
There's a good bit of implicit stuff going on -- JS wakes up, gets the search index, and finds results client-side, then updates the correct node.

## Future Work

In this site design step, we've just scratched the surface.
There's a lot more that can be done, that should be done:

- Favicon
- Meta tags and canonical links
- Sidebars
- Everything in Sphinx's `basic/layout.html`
