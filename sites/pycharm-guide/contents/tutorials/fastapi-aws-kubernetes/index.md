[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

This tutorial will be entirely focused on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) along-with playing with titans 
like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) & [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

There are a lot of features we are going to cover : 

* Working with SQLAlchemy & Alembic
* Implementing APIs along-with securing with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Integrating with Celery & Redis
* Async Tests
* Helm Charts
* Deploying Apps using Kubernetes & AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)


Note: *We'll be using PyCharm Professional Edition for all the steps in this tutorial.*
