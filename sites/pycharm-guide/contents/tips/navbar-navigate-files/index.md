    *The no-distraction way to move around your project tree.*

    Move up, down, and around in the Navigation Bar, from the cozy confines of the 
    mouse. Get to the file or directory you want, then do what you need...open a 
    file, make a new directory, find in path at the location.

We've discussed "getting into the flow"...strip down the IDE to focus and don't 
take your hands off the keyboard. But if you've turned off your Project tool 
window, how can you navigate files and directories?

You could use the `Project` action (`Alt-1` Win/Linux, `Cmd-1` macOS) to bring 
back the Project tool, do your work, and then hide it again. Instead, 
temporarily bring back the Navigation Bar then navigate it with the keyboard.

You can use the left arrow to go up a directory and right arrow to go down 
a directory. To see the contents of a directory, either press the down arrow 
or press enter. With this you can get to any place in the tree, without 
using the mouse.

For looking at the directory the currently-edited file is in, this is even 
easier. Activating the Navigation Bar makes the current file selected. You 
don't have to press `Left` to select the parent directory. Just press 
`Down`.
