  *Opening files doesn't have to mean the Project Tool or mouse.*

  If you know the name -- or parts of the name -- of the file, 
  open it quickly with ``Navigate to File`` and speed search.

Navigating your project files is a chore. Expanding folders and
subfolders, scrolling, double-clicking. It breaks your flow and
makes you think about administrivia.

Wouldn't it be great if your tool knew everything about every file,
and let you just jump to things by typing?

The `Navigate to File` action (`Shift-Ctrl-N`, `Shift-Cmd-O`
on macOS) makes this actually...fun. The non-disruptive popup
appears and you just start typing parts of the filename until you
see the file you're looking for. No trees, no mouse.

Use the same hump-case "speed search" syntax to filter the listing
with parts of filename fragments. Use slashes to indicate that a
file should be in part of the directory structure. Click the
checkbox to look outside of your project files, into your dependencies.

If you want to jump to a file, `Navigate to File` is a speedy,
non-disruptive option.
