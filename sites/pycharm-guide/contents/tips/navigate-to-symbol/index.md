  *The best way to move around the code in your project.*

  Want to get from A to B? Don't think of B as files. Think 
  in terms of code.

  We are hardwired to think of moving around the "files" in our 
  project. But we have a smart IDE that makes it fast to jump to 
  the symbols in our code.

Decades of old habits make us think of files, with their deeply-nested
locations and obscure, inconsistent file names and extensions. Our brains
are already full. Who has time to memorize all the files in the project?

Don't. Instead, think of the _code_ in your project, not the files.
Want to jump to a class, function, or variable? You have a smart IDE
that's indexed the universe. Put it to work and use the
`Navigate by Symbol` action (`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-N`, `Alt-Cmd-O` on
macOS) quickly, without disruption, get to where you want to go.

When the popup appears, start speed typing to get to the symbol, using
the "camel hump" syntax universal to speed searching.

Once you select your choice, PyCharm not only opens the file but
puts the cursor on the spot of the declaration of the symbol.

Remember, this isn't just for Python symbols. This matches in JS, CSS,
SQL, etc.
