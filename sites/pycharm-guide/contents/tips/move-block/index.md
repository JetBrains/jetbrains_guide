    *Move lines and blocks, up or down, using the keyboard.*    

    When you're in the flow, you want to re-arrange code fast. 
    Use this tip to move code around without cut-and-paste.

We want to operate on code in the editor fast. Using Cut-and-Paste is 
kinda fast, but there's a better way that doesn't temporarily remove the 
code from your file.

Make a selection ([without using the mouse](../make-extend-selection/)) 
and use `` (`Shift-Alt-Up/Down` Win/Linux, `Alt-Shift-Up/Down` macOS) 
to move that selection to the target line. The selection gets dragged 
along, in view.

With cut-and-paste, you have semi-dangerously remove your code, then 
make a new line to put place the selection, then paste.
