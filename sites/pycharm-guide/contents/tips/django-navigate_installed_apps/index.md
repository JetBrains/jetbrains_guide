    *Quickly jump to your Django Application from settings.INSTALLED_APPS*    

    PyCharm allows you to jump from any string within your 
    `INSTALLED_APP` (in `settings.py`) list to the application in question.
    This is just one of the things that PyCharm does to make your `settings.py`
    file more interactive.
