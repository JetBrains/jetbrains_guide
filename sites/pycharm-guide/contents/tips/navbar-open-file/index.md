    *Need a fast, no-distraction way to open a file in your project tree?*

    When you need to browse to a directory to find and open file, the 
    Navigation Bar is your best bet. Keyboard-first, use the cursor 
    keys to select, then press enter.

If you've closed the Project Tool window and hidden the Navigation 
Bar, you need a way to open file that's keyboard centric and doesn't 
disrupt your flow. Usually, the fastest way to open a file is the 
various search options (`Recent Files`, `Navigate to File`, etc.) 
But other times, you want to browse instead of search.

As shown previously, use the Navigation Bar to select a file:

- Activate the Navigation Bar with 
`Navigate -> Jump to Navigation Bar` (`Alt-Home` Win/Linux, 
`Cmd-Up` macOS)

- Use the cursor keys to get to the target directory

- Speed search to select the file

Once selected in the Navigation Bar, press `Enter` and the IDE will 
open your file. Clicking with the mouse also works.

As a note, this is a very common pattern for jumping to a file in 
the current directory. In this case, you don't have to press 
`Left` to go up to the directory. Even though the  current file selected, 
you can still press `Down` or better still, just start speed searching.

Opening the file isn't the only operation you can do on a selected 
Navigation Bar item. You can `Refactor This`, delete...basically, 
anything you could do when you click on the file in the Project Tool. 
We'll see two examples in subsequent tips.
