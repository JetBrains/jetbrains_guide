  *Want the easiest way to jump between files?*

  Mouseless == navigating files by keyboard.

  Switching between files...we all do this, all the time. 
  Use the ``Recent Files`` action to quickly jump between 
  the files you are working on.

It's hard to divorce the mouse. "How do I jump between files?" The
good news: there are better ways.

Starting with this one. Use the `Recent Files` action to quickly
jump between the files you are working on. You get a low-disruption
popup which is keyboard friendly, letting you jump between files you
are actively looking at.

You can invoke this with the `Recent Files` action, `Ctrl-E` on
Windows/Linux and `Cmd-E` on the Mac. It brings up the `Recent Files`
popup, which you can dismiss using `Esc` without taking an action.

Often you toggle between two files. By default, `Recent Files` has
your previous file already selected. Thus, `Ctrl-E, Enter` lets you
flip back and forth.

If your file is further down the `Recent Files` list, you can use
your mouse (bad) or keyboard arrows (better) to move the selection
before pressing enter. But there's a much better way:
[speed search](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/speed-search-in-the-tool-windows.html).
After pressing `Ctrl-E`, just start typing and the list filters. The
typed expression can be parts of filenames, include parts of parent
directory names, etc.

As we'll show in another tip, `Recent Files` doesn't just work with
files: it also lets you mouse/cursor/speed-search into the left
column for tools. One less set of shortcuts to memorize.

The `Recent Files` action lists files you've visited. Perhaps you want
a more _focused_ list of files you've edited. Try the
`Recently Changed Files` action...same as `Recent Files` but with
`Shift`.
