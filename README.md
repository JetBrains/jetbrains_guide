# PyCharm Guide

The PyCharm guide is a collection of resources for learning PyCharm. 
Similar to an "Awesome PyCharm" but richer in content and formatting. The 
Guide is intended as an open source project.

** This is still in quiet mode, preview, etc. **

## Technology

- Content as markdown files in a repository

- Rendered to a semi-static site using Gatsby

- Available as open source

## Status

In November 2018, this Guide is in MVP-status. It's ready for a very 
quiet launch with a few tips, with a code base that is quite
intentionally ugly and un-refactored.

Nearest-term goals:

- Put more tips in

- Refactor the ugliness and re-add the Jest tests

- Bring back the other content types (tutorial, article, etc.)

- Add in some missing features

- Make into more of a community project

## Installation

- npm install

- npm run start
