ReactJS is wildly popular and thus wildly supported. TypeScript is increasingly popular, 
and thus increasingly supported.

The two together? Not as much. Given that they both change quickly, its
hard to find accurate learning materials.

React+TypeScript, with PyCharm? That three-part combination is the topic
of this series. We'll show a little about a lot. Meaning, the key steps
to getting productive, in PyCharm, for React projects using TypeScript. Along
the way we'll show test-driven development and emphasize tips-and-tricks in
the IDE.
