With PyCharm you can test your Python applications
using one of your favorite testing frameworks:
- Create tests
- Run tests on demand and automatically
- Parametrize tests, use sets of testing data
- Implement test scenarios
- Configure tests
- Test for different Python versions
- Obtain statistics with Coverage

You can run tests in parallel on several CPUs to optimize execution of your pytest tests.
