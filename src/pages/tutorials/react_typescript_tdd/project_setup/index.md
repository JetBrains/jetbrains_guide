  ## Go tabless

  *There are better choices. Let's turn off tabs.*

  Tabs are a great way to focus on the few files for a 
  task. But they have some downsides.

  Try disabling your tabs as a first step towards a 
  more-focused, keyboard-centric workflow.

People love tabs. It's the default way in PyCharm to jump around
between the few files you are working on for a task.

But tabs have downsides:

- _Lots of mousing_. Sure, you can learn some keystrokes to move
  between tabs, but they are a visual metaphor, and people
  instinctively use the mouse.

- _Clutter_. Before long you have tons of tabs open and then need
  other machinery to help deal with tabs...which you used to
  help deal with files.

In this tip we show turning off tabs as a prelude to other tips
related to keyboard-centric navigation. We show navigating through
preferences to the action, as well as searching for the action
and even setting it in the popup.
