    ## Highlight The Point
    
    *Make some text as emphasizing the key point.*
    
    By default, PyCharm has lots of features visible and available. 
    As you learn your way around, you want to give more space to 
    the editor and focus on your coding.
    
    In this tip we disable a number of default toolbars and then 
    hide the file browser.

People associate IDEs with busy UIs filled with buttons and knobs 
and distraction. But that's just the default. It doesn't 
have to be that way. Once you get oriented, you can turn off 
everything you don't need and get a lean coding experience.

In this tip we use the ``View`` menu to disable 3 toolbars. We 
then take the big step of hiding the Project Tool window, with its 
file explorer. 

"How will I navigate to my files?" you ask. Later  tips will answer 
that, ultimately with: "You don't." Meaning, you grow out of 
"files" as a useful place to jump to.
