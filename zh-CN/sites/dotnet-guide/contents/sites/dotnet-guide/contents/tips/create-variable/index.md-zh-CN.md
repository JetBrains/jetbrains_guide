  **Struggling with long lines of code?** 🙇‍♀️

  Existing expressions can easily be assigned to a new variable using the **Introduce Variable** refactoring. We can either select the expression and invoke **Refactor | Introduce Variable** or type `.var` at the end of the expression to invoke the related **postfix template**. The refactoring also takes repeated occurrences of our expression into account to **reduce code duplication**.

  Of course, inlining a variable is equally easy using the **Refactor | Inline Variable** refactoring.

  Remember to always use meaningful names! 🏷
