### Keyboard Shortcuts

Rider has many keyboard shortcuts, and they all depend on which operating system you are using. Don't be overwhelmed, there are two essential shortcuts that help you achieve anything in Rider! They work cross-platform, and across all JetBrains IDE's:

* <kbd>Shift, Shift</kbd>, which brings up <b><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Searching_Everywhere.html">Search Everywhere</a></b>. From here, you can navigate to types, symbols, files, recent files, actions, tool windows, run configurations, and preferences.
* <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>, which brings up a contextual menu with all actions that apply.

Windows, menus and pop-ups will show more keyboard shortcut hints, so you can learn them along the way.

In case you are looking for a full overview, use these cheat sheets to master your Rider keyboard scheme of choice:

### Search Everywhere

With [Search Everywhere](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Searching_Everywhere.html) (<kbd>Shift, Shift</kbd>), you can navigate to types, symbols, files, recent files, actions, tool windows, run configurations, and preferences.

The tool window lets you search, do partial matches, search for starting characters for results written in CamelCase, and so on.

### Inspections, Quick-Fixes and Context Actions

The <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd> shortcut brings up a context menu that contains quick-fixes, and context actions.

Quick-fixes are available for bits of code that triggered an inspection (code style, language features, code smells, potential errors, etc.)

We will go deeper into inspections and quick-fixes later on.

### Editing

While coding, you will spend a lot of time in the [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Working_in_the_Editor.html).

In the editor, we get code completion, and can complete statements. There are live templates, and [postfix templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Postfix_Templates.html#list) which can help us write code.

With [expand/shrink selection](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Selecting_Text_in_the_Editor.html), you can select code using its semantics, rather than using just characters and lines. Similarly, you can [rearrange code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Coding_Assistance__Moving_Code_Elements.html) and move expressions, statements, type members, and other elements in your code around.
