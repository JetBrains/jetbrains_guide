Blazor and GraphQL combined will revolutionize how we build rich SPA applications with pure .NET. Blazor, for the first time in years, gives .NET developers the ability to develop applications that run in the browser. This allows us to use our knowledge that we acquired in the backend or with desktop applications on the web.

GraphQL on the other hand changed how we work with data fetching. With GraphQL, the frontend developer defines how the interface between the frontend and the backend looks. We no longer have friction between backend and frontend developers and are able to iterate much faster.

Let us explore how we can put those together and change how we design components by binding them to GraphQL fragments. With GraphQL, the data becomes front and center and drives our application.

After having a fundamental understanding of how GraphQL improves our data fetching needs in web applications, we will move on and build a nice real-time application with Blazor and GraphQL. Let’s build a truly engaging next gen application and push Blazor to the limit!
