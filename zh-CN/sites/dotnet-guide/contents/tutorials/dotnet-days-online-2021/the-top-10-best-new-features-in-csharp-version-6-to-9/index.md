There are a lot of cool and usable new features being added to C#. However, way too many of us are too busy building stuff, and fixing/creating bugs, to have the time to sit down and take it all in. So why not let Chris Klug walk you through his top 10 new features that have been added in C# version 6 to 9?

Sure, C# has gotten a LOT more than 10 new things since version 6. But if you are a busy developer, like most of us are, getting an introduction to the top 10 ones in just an hour, could be a great start. In this talk, Chris will show and explain, his personal top-10 favorite features that have been added to C# in the last few years. Everything from awesome time savers and stability contributors, to syntax changes that allows your code to be denser and easier to read.

### About the Presenter

**Chris Klug, Developer, Active Solution**

Chris Klug is a developer badass-as-a-service that either creates or solves problems depending on who you ask. He loves creating and building things. Whether it be a new application, a new kitchen, or a new RC helicopter, you will see him building things all the time. Most of the time, that means writing code and solving problems for clients at a company called Active Solution in Stockholm, though. Except for the many days he spends at conferences and user groups, talking about doing things he is passionate about, and for the days he goes mountain biking, IPSC shooting, kiteboarding, or RC helicopter flying.

For the last 15-something years, he has been solving problems for customers, and loving it. But if he gets to choose, he'll go to the beach and kitesurf every day!
