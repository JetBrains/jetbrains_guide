Let's start by setting some expectations. In the Rider Essentials series, JetBrains .NET developer advocates Rachel, Khalid, Matthias, Matt and Maarten, will show you their favourite tips and tricks, uncovering how they work with Rider.

We assume you are already familiar with Rider, so we can focus on the essential topics that will help you get more out of the IDE.
