ReSharper makes Visual Studio a much better IDE! ReSharper extends Visual Studio with over 2200 on-the-fly code inspections for C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, JavaScript, TypeScript and other technologies. For most inspections, ReSharper provides quick-fixes (light bulbs) to improve the code.

Find and remove unused code? Migrate your code to the latest C# version? Convert loops to LINQ at will? Find and prevent possible exceptions? Use a common naming standard? All that and a lot more code improvements are made possible with ReSharper's code analysis.
