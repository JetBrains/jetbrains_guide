  You can change the font weights for your code. In settings or preferences, **⌘,** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+S** (Windows/Linux), go to Editor -> Font, choose a different weight for the main code, and for the bolder sections. There's a preview area on the right so you can see the effect of your changes.
