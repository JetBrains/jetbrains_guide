  You can use **⌘⇧A** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Shift+A** (Windows/Linux) and then type in _machine learning_ to toggle Machine Learning Code Completion on.

  Java Code Completion is based on machine learning (ML), which is an alternative to the standard ranking mechanism. This data has been gathered from our EAPs. Note that we do not collect any source code, only information about your interactions with the code completion UI.
