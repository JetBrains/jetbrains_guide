## Summary and Resources
In this tutorial we used the [New Project Wizard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-project-wizard.html) in IntelliJ IDEA to create a Spring Boot project with the **Spring Web** dependency.

We created a Spring Controller and served some text to the local Tomcat webserver. Finally, we added a test for our HTTP call.

### Resources
- I referenced [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to create this tutorial.

- The [New Project Wizard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/new-project-wizard.html) in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate uses [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to create the project behind the scenes.

- There are lots of [guides](https://spring.io/guides) available on the Spring website that you can also have a play with. I recommend you work through more of them, especially if you're interested in Spring development and learning more.

- You can [read more about Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and the project is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).

- Finally, there are lots of [excellent blogs](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides) from [Marco Behler](https://twitter.com/MarcoBehler) that you can explore (all under the _Spring_ header).
