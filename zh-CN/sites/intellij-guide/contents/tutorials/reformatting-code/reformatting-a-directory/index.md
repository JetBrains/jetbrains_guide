### Reformatting a Whole Directory
Alternatively, you can [reformat a specific directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html#reformat_module_directory). This option is really useful if you're reformatting a larger project in stages. You can perform the reformat at directory with **⌘1** (macOS), or **Alt+1** (Windows/Linux) to display the Project Window and then right-click on the directory you want to reformat. From the context menu you can press the **Reformat Code** option to reformat all the code in that directory:

Alternatively, you can select the directory and use **⌘⌥L** (macOS), or **Ctrl+Alt+L** (Windows/Linux) to display the same dialog.

## EditorConfig
IntelliJ IDEA also supports [EditorConfig files](https://editorconfig.org/). In the next step of this tutorial we will take a look at why they're useful and how to use them.
