## Configuring IntelliJ IDEA with Search Everywhere
You can also search for and change preferences/settings for IntelliJ IDEA by using Search Everywhere. Press *Shift* twice to bring up the Search Everywhere dialog. You can now type in what you're looking for. Once again, we could search for things like _font_, _folding_, _comments_, _braces_, _commit_, and much more.

If you do prefer Search Everywhere as your go-to shortcut, you can also use Find Actions which is **⌘⇧A** (macOS), or **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**A** (Windows/Linux) to restrict the search results to those that are more likely to relate to preferences/settings.
