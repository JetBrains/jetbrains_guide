## Sharing IntelliJ IDEA Settings
You can [share IDE Settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html) between your different instances of IntelliJ IDEA, or with your colleagues.

If you want to share settings across instances of IntelliJ IDEA and you are using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate you can use [IDE Settings Sync](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#IDE_settings_sync) to achieve this. If you are using our Community Edition you can [export your settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) and subsequently import them.

If you want to share IntelliJ IDEA settings with your colleagues, you can use a [Settings Repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository) to keep everyone in sync.
