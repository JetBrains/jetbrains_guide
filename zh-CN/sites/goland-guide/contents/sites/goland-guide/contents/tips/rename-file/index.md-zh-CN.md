  *Rename files with peace of mind.*

  Changed your name about what you named a file, and now you need to rename
  the test and example files too? Let the IDE handle all this work.

  **How to use:**

  Invoke the **Rename Refactoring** via _Shift + F6 on Windows/Linux_ or _⇧ + F6 on macOS_,
  and do the work, safely and quickly.
