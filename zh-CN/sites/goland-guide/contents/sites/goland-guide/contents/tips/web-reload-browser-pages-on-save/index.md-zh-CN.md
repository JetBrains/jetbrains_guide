  The IDE can automatically reload the page opened in a browser after you make changes to an HTML file, or the linked CSS and JavaScript files.

  **How to use:**

  First, open the file from the IDE via the icon on the upper right-side of the editor or via _View | Open in Browser | <browser name>_.

  Reloading is triggered whenever changes are saved in the IDE, either automatically or using Press _Ctrl + S on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + S on macOS_, or when changes are made to a file externally.
