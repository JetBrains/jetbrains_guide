  GoLand offers a builtin feature to allow you to run the tests
  in your project and display the coverage in a tool window as a
  summary for a package (folder) and file, and for each file,
  next to each line in the file.

  **How to use:**
  Launch the test with **Coverage** support and then use the
  **Coverage** tool window to navigate to your packages/files and
  see their coverage.
