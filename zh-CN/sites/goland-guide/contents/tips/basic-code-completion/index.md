  **Basic completion** provides a list of _all symbols_ available at the current caret position.

  The list will include the usual mix of type, interface, and method names, keywords, and also _Live Templates_.

  _Symbols from not-yet-imported packages_ are also offered, with autoimport on-the-fly when you select them.

  **How to use:**

  Basic completion pops up as you start typing code and GoLand recognizes
  an opportunity to complete something for you, but you can invoke it anytime by pressing _Ctrl + Space on Windows/Linux_ or _⌃ + Space on macOS_.

  **Pro tip:**

  _Basic Code Completion_ is also available for non-English symbols.
