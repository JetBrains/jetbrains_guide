  Do you want to select all the occurrences of a piece of code?

  **How to use:**

  Press _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + J on Windows/Linux_, and _⌘ + ^ + G on macOS_.

  After the selection is complete, you can start editing all the fragments
  as if they were all the same one.

  **Pro tip:**

  If you plan to use this feature to rename something,
  then you should have a look at our [Rename refactoring](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2018/12/07/refactorings-in-goland-rename-refactoring/), which is designed
  to work safely across multiple packages, not just at the file level,
  with full preview and undo support.
