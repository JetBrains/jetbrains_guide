  The IDE will show you completion suggestions based on the type used in the function call for the parameters in the function body.

  **How to use:**

  You don't need to do anything to use this feature as the IDE will automatically infer the code suggestions based on what you typed already.

  **Pro tip:** Use the Smart Type Completion, _Ctrl + Shift + Space on Windows/Linux_ or _^ + ⇧ + Space on macOS_, to narrow-down the list further.
