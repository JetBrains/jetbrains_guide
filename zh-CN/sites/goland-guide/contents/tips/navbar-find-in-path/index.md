  *Need a fast way to find files in a path, without disrupting your flow?*

  Closed the _Project Tool Window_ and need to find a file somewhere in the project tree?

  **How to use:**

  Activate the **Navigation Bar**, _Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + ↑ on macOS_.

  Then navigate to the target, and use **Find in Path**, _Ctrl + Shift + F on Windows/Linux_
  or _⌘ + ⇧ + F on macOS_, from the keyboard.
