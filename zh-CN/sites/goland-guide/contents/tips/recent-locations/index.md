  The **Recent Locations** pop-up allows you to search for a specific change or recently viewed piece of code.

  **How to use:**

  Invoke it using _Ctrl + Shift + E on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + ⇧ + E on macOS_, and the list
  of recently viewed files will display not only the file name but also the code snippets
  around the area last viewed in the file.

  **Pro tip:**

  Invoke the same shortcut again, and only the changed files will be visible.

  The best part? _Speed Typing_ works here: you can type in code to filter the results further.
