  **Local History** will come to the rescue whenever just deleted all the work you did for days by mistake.

  **How to use:**

  You can invoke it at any time by using the **Local History** command either via
  _Search Everywhere_, or by right-clicking on the folder/file.

  **Pro tip:**

  You can also see the difference between different points in time, and you can put
  labels on known points in time to make sure you can always return to a safe state.

  例如：通过测试后，会自动打上标记。

  By default, changes are retained for 5 days, but
  [this is configurable](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/local-history.html#retention).
