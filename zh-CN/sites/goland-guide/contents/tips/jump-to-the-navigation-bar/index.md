  The **Navigation Bar** has a useful feature that can help you get an overview of both your current location and the
  structure of the project itself.

  **How to use:**

  Press _Alt + Home on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + ↑ on macOS_, and it will appear.

  Use the _Arrow keys_ to move around inside and press _Enter_ to enter a certain folder or
  _Esc_ to exit from it.

  **Pro tip:**

  _Speed Search_ is available here and it will help you quickly filter the files in your view.
