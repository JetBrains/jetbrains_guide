  **Postfix Completion** lets you transform an expression into another one
  , based on the postfix you specify after the dot, the current context, and the expression type.

  For example, you can turn a bool expression into an if statement, or create a pointer to an expression. If anything goes not as planned, everything can be reverted via simple _Ctrl + Z on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + Z on macOS_.

  **How to use:**

  Open the _Postfix Completion_ page via _Settings/Preferences | Editor | General_ to see the complete list of supported templates.

  **Pro tip:**

  - _Postfix Completion_ options are displayed as a part of the `Basic Completion` suggestions list. Press _Ctrl + J on Windows/Linux_ or _⌘ + J on macOS_ to see a full list of the _Postfix Completion_ templates applicable in the current context.
  - You can change the names of all _Postfix Completions_ in the Settings/Preferences dialog.
  - In the same dialog, you can also disable the templates you don't need, or even turn off _Postfix Completion_ completely.
