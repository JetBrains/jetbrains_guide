  Need to change the case of struct tag keys?

  Choose between *snake_case*, *(lower) camelCase*,
  *(upper) CamelCase*, or *kebap-case* and apply this to the whole
  struct in a few steps.

  **How to use:**

  Place the cursor on a struct field, then invoke the
  *Context Actions* menu via _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_
  or _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_.

  Select the *Change field name style in tags*, and choose
  between one of the four styles available.
