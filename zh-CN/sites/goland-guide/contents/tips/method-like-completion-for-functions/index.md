  **Method-like completion for functions** allows you to search for functions
  based on their first parameter.

  Imagine you are new to Go and want to split a string.

  You know that there must be a function for that, most likely it's
  called `Split` and accepts a string as the first argument,
  but you don't know the exact name of the function and its package.

  Here's where method-like completion comes in handy, offering you
  a list of all suitable functions, automatically importing it upon selection.

  **How to use:**

  Hold down the _Ctrl_ key and press _Space_ twice.
