  *Stop stepping.*

  Have a breakpoint in a loop and find yourself clicking **Continue**
  repeatedly? Change your breakpoint to only stop when a condition is met.

  **How to use:**

  Edit the breakpoint properties via _Ctrl + Shift + F8 on Windows/Linux_,
  or _⇧ + ⌘ + F8 on macOS_, then type in the **Condition** you want.
