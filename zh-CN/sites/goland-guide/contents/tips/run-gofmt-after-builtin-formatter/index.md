  Make sure your code is always formatted with gofmt.

  **How to use:**

  To use this feature, check the **On code reformat** option under _Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Go | Other_.

  Now you can use the default shortcut, _Ctrl + Alt + L_ on Windows/Linux or _⌘ + ⌥ + L_ on macOS, to trigger the builtin formatter.

  **Pro tip**: You can also search for **Run gofmt** in the IDE _Settings/Preferences_, and activate the option as described above.
