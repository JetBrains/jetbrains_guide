  Place the cursor within the literal (_between_ the quotation marks) and press
  _Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux_ or _⌥ + ⏎ on macOS_, select **Inject language or reference**,
  choose which one of supported injection language you want to use and
  start typing, auto-completion will appear instantly.
