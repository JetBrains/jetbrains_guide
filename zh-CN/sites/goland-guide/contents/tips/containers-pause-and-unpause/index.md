  When you need to test how a micro-service behaves when another one is unavailable, use the pause feature. Then resume it without the hassle of starting the container from scratch.

  **How to use:**

  Select one or multiple running containers that you want to pause or resume, then click on the **Pause** or **Resume** button in the **Services** window.
