  You got it right, debugger also has code completion! GoLand provides
  suggestions list when you evaluate the state of your application in a
  debugging session.

  **How to use:**

  As you start typing in the _Evaluate Expression_, _Watches_ or _Conditional Breakpoints_ dialogs, code
  completion will appear immediately.
