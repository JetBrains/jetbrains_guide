  **Make switching conversations easy!**

  Recent conversations are shown first in Space. Conversations can be pinned (and unpinned)
  to make switching between conversations easy.

  While threads keep conversations in Space organized and focused, they are typically shown
  in the context of an existing chat.

  **Threads can be pinned as well!** Pinned threads are shown as individual conversations,
  showing separate notifications in the side bar. Switching to a thread becomes really easy,
  and helps continue where you left off.
