  **Use Space issues your way!**

  Every project in Space has a built-in issue tracker. It can be used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, design questions, and more.

  Using the issue status, we can indicate at what stage that issue currently is. There are four predefined statuses: `open`, `in progress`, `done`, and `backlog`.

  We can add other options in our project's settings. For example, we can add a new status `won't fix`, which represents issues that the team decided not to work on. Additionally, our status can resolve the issue, so it won't show in the *Open issues*  search.
