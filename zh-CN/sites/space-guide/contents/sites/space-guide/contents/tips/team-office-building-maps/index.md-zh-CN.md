  **Where can I find my colleagues?**

  Find a team member's profile (tip: use **Go to Anything** (<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> on macOS)) and see where they are seated. Space shows the building floor plan and lets you zoom and pan to see who else may be nearby.

  In the team directory, we can filter by location and look at an office building floor plan.
