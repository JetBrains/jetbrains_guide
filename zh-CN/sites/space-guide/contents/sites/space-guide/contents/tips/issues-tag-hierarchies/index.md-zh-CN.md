  **Keep projects issues organized!**

  Attach issue tags to specify its category, priority, association with other issues, or other useful information. Tags can also be used to group or filter issues on the issue list.

  Create tag hierarchies that can be expanded and collapsed in the issue list. Use "/" (forward slash) in tag names to indicate their hierarchy.
