  **What broke the build?**

  In Space, you can see an overview of current and previous automation job executions. You can check details for each job, look at their status, and dive into the logs when needed.

  But how do you stay informed without having to check manually? This is where notifications come in.

  Subscribe to those notifications you are interested in. Want to get pinged when a job runs? Or only when a job fails? For your commits only, or for everybody on the team? The choice is yours.

  Sit back and relax while your CI/CD runs, a message will come from Space when it matters to you.
