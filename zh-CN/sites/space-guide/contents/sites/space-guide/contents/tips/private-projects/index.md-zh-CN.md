  **Create private projects when it makes sense!**

  Need a temporary project for yourself? Want to share some code, issues, or checklists with just one or several colleagues? Create a private project!

  A private project is only visible to its members â€” other people in the organization won't be able to see and access it.

  We'll need to specify who can see and access the project. If later we want to make the project public inside the organization, we can do so from the project settings (under *Info*).
