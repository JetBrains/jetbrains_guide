  **Reduce information overload!**

  In Blog, you can create and view articles, announcements and events.

  Blog posts can be **targeted to specific teams and/or locations**. This ensures the information
  is only visible to relevant team members by default. They will get a notification, and the information
  will be shown on their home page. Others will not see the post automatically,
  greatly reducing information overload!

  From the Blog section, we can view all articles and announcements, even those targeted to specific audiences.
  Filter them out as you prefer, search through content, and follow along about what is going on in your organization.
