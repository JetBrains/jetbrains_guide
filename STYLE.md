* Short Tip title

* Have the Tip subtitle be the sentence that will go in Twitter

* Make the Tip body text follow what is narrated in video
    
* `Find Action` (blah for Windows/Linux, blah for macOS)

    - `+` for combined, `|` for sequence
    
* Write for busy people (make is scannable...bulleted lists, italics)

    - "Before" section of bullets to get into the spot being shown
    
    - "Now" section of bullets to demo what's being taught
        
* Frontmatter "leadin" shouldn't have headings

    - But make the first line italics, posing a question
   
* UI elements with camel case...Navigation Bar (not navigation bar)
    
* Go back at the end and put inter-doc markdown references as 
appropriate

* Open (leadin and/or first paragraph of body) with a statement of 
"why" (i.e. the problem being solved)

    - Instead of: "Use the keyboard and Navigation Bar to open a 
      file somewhere in the project"
                   
    - Use: "Open a file somewhere in the project using the keyboard 
      and Navigation Bar"
                   
* Make new Topic and Technology entries as appropriate

* Good usage of See Also to point to help topics
