  **Announce an event, provide context & get RSVPs**

  If you want to notify your colleagues of an upcoming event (e.g. a conference, meet-up, party, all-hands meeting)
  and want to find out who will be able to attend it, you can publish a calendar event with a poll.

  Providing context about the event, as well as the ability to comment and add reactions
  helps build excitement and gather feedback.

  Interested in going? Members of your organization can RSVP immediately and respond with yes/no/maybe.
  The event will be added automatically to their calendar.
