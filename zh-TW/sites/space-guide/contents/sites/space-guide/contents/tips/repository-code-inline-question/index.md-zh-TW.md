  **Ask questions and discuss code in Git repositories**

  Space makes it easy for you and your team to review code, discuss changes, and keep track of accumulated knowledge.

  Have a question or want to discuss? Ask it inline! Mention your team or specific colleagues so they get a chat notification.

  Those involved can navigate to the code and discuss inline if they ant to, or simply respond from within their chat.
