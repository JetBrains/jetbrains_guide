  **Share a link to the current page from the Space Desktop apps!**

  The Space Desktop apps for Windows, macOS and Linux let us work with all aspects of Space,
  and receive desktop notifications.

  But there is no address bar! How can we share a link to the current page?

  Hovering over the Space icon on the left reveals actions to open the current page in the browser,
  and to copy a link to the current page so we can share it.
