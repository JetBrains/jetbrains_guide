  **Reduce overhead in managing channel members!**

  We can add individual members to chat channels, as well as teams!

  Teams make it easy to add the right folks. Create a channel for your team, or for cross-team work.

  Future team members are added automatically, making chats with one or more teams much more convenient to manage!
