  **Navigate Space at warp speed!**

  Many actions and items can be navigate to with keyboard shortcuts.

  At any place, press <kbd>?</kbd> to view available keyboard shortcuts. For navigation, we can press <kbd>G</kbd> (for *Go*), followed by another letter.

  Quickly navigate to projects, teams, chats, and more. All of the items in Space are at your fingertips.

  Need to navigate to a more specific location, such as a commit or a colleague's profile page? Check the [Go to Anything tips](/space/guide/playlists/go-to-anything-tips/).
