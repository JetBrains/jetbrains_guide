  **Tell Space what you are after!**

  Go to Anything (<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> on macOS) lets us find and navigate to everything. We can provide it with context...

  Want to search for a team? Append "team". A chat, perhaps? Append "chat". Looking for a project? Append "project".

  Press <kbd>tab</kbd> and search within the previous result. Within a project context, we can search for issues, checklists, code reviews and repositories. In a repository, we can search for files.
