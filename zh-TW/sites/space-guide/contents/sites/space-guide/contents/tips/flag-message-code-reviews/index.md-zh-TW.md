  **Flag a message in Code Review for follow-up**

  You can mark messages in the Code Review Timeline with a *Resolved* / *Unresolved* status.

  This feature is useful for drawing attention to something that requires action. Space will not let you close the code review until all issues are resolved.

  Go to a Code Review, make sure you're on the **Timeline** tab, and do one of the following:
  * To mark a message unresolved, hover over the message and click on the `!` icon.
  * To mark a message resolved, click on **Resolve** above the message.

  You can also unflag a discussion by using the `!` icon again.
