  **Add issue fields that are important for your organization’s workflows**

  To configure custom fields, go to **Project | Issues | Settings**, click *'Custom Fields'*, and click the *'New Field'* button. Creating a custom field only takes three steps:

  1. Give the field a name.
  2. Select a field type, along with any other options you need.
  3. Click *'Save'*.

  You can configure custom fields of the following types: **Text**, **Number**, **List**, **Checkbox**, **Date**, **Date & Time**, **Percentage**, and **Link**.
  You can also attach Space entities, such as **Teams**, **Organization members**, **Locations**, **Issues**, and **Projects**, to your issues.

  After you’ve added a custom field, you can specify its value when creating a new issue or when modifying existing issues.

  Please note that you need to be a project administrator or have the necessary permissions to manage issue settings in your project.
