  Space Chats are the primary place to communicate with your colleagues, and stay up-to-date.

  You can chat with folks in your organization using public and private channels, and use direct messages to have private chats with one or more people.

  Notifications are sent in chats, too. They are your personal inbox for notifications, requests, and alerts.

## 💡 Tip 1: Quick access to Channel Information

Need quick access to channel information? Click the channel icon in the header!

This works for all channels and direct messages. Channel information shows who is subscribed, a summary of pinned messages, and any media that may be shared.

## 💡 Tip 2: Common actions in the contact list

Want to pin (or unpin) a channel? Unsubscribe? Enable or disable notifications?

You can do this from the channel settings, and from the contact list. This is especially useful if you want to quickly perform these actions in multiple channels -- no need to switch channels all the time.

## 💡 Tip 3: Copy link to message or open it in browser

Need to share a message? Or want to open it in the browser?

When you click the message date, Space will copy a link to your clipboard. <kbd>Ctrl + click</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘ + click</kbd> on macOS) to open the link in the browser.

## 💡 Tip 4: Collapse Pinned/All chats to one line

In the contact list, you can collapse chats to one line. You can do this for all chats, or just favorite chats. This will make the contact list more compact and easier to browse. When a message is sent to a channel or a thread, the contact list will expand for that item.

Use the settings icon, and then **Appearance**, to configure which channels to collapse to one line. As a bonus, you can also show/hide chat tab labels here.

## 💡 Tip 6: Turn off unused tabs

In the contact list, tabs are shown for the various types of chats you have. It shows channels, DMs, threads, reviews, issues, and automation.

If you're not using all of them, you can remove the tabs you don't need. Use the settings icon, and customize the tabs in your contact list. Hidden tabs are still available when you click their title in the settings.
