  If the plugin cannot automatically infer the available Kubernetes namespaces, now you can configure them manually. This will solve the problem when the user does not have the required permissions to perform namespace listing.

  **How to use:**

  Go to _Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Kubernetes_ and configure the namespace in the corresponding section.

  **Note:** You must have the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10485-kubernetes">Kubernetes plugin</a> provided by JetBrains installed for this action to work.
