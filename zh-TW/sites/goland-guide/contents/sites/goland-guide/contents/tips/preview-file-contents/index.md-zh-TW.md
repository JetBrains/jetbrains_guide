  **How to use:**

  On the _Project View_ tool window, locate the gear icon, then click on it and select **Enable Preview Tab** option. After that, click on a file in the _Project View_ and it will allow you to preview its contents without creating a new tab that you then need to close.

  **Pro tip:** You can also locate the _Enable Preview Tab_ option using _Search Everywhere_, _Shift + Shift_, and turn it on.
