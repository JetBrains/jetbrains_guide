  **Call Hierarchy** allows you to quickly see all the places where a function or method is used.

  **How to use:**

  Press _Ctrl + Alt + H on Windows/Linux_, _⌥ + ^ + H on macOS_, and the
  _Call Hierarchy_ tool window will open up with all the places that the function is called inside.

  **Pro tip:**

  This works for interface methods, type methods, methods, and calls.

  You can then drill down into the call chain to see where those other functions are called.

  _Speed Typing_ is available to help you quickly navigate to the element you need.
