  GoLand can complete statements and add required trailing commas for any
  composite literals (like struct, slice, etc.), and even place caret in a
  position where you can just start typing the next statement.

  **How to use:**

  After typing parentheses, trigger the **Complete Current Statement** action,
  _Ctrl + Shift + Enter on Windows/Linux_ and _⇧ + ⌘ + Enter on macOS_, to add curly braces and move
  the cursor down to the beginning of the next row.
