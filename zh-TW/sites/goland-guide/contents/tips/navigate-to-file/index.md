  The **Navigate to file** feature allows us to search for a file by name, even if we know only part of it.

  You to search for a file in the current project only, your source code only, or
  all places. This means you can search in other places like _Go Modules_ dependencies and _GOROOT_.

  **How to use:**

  Press _Ctrl + Shift + N on Windows/Linux_, _⌘ + ⇧ + O on macOS_ to invoke the **Navigate to file** pop-up.

  **Pro tip:**

  As a hidden gem, try finding a directory by name.
