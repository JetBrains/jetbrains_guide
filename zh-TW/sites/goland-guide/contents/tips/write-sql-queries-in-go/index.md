  SQL queries are recognized automatically when these strings are used in popular SQL packages such as _database/sql_, _github.com/jmoiron/sqlx_, and _github.com/gobuffalo/pop_.

  The IDE automatically recognizes which databases are configured, their type, e.g. Postgres, MongoDB, etc., and provides all features available to query, refactor, or reference the database.

  **How to use:**

  Use the string literal which contains the SQL query in any of the functions accepting queries from one of the supported packages and they'll be recognized automatically.
