  **How to use:**

  Invoke the **Switcher** using _Ctrl + Tab on Windows/Linux_ or _^ + Tab on macOS_.

  **Pro tip:**

  You can use it to quickly switch between the previous file and the current one using the shortcut.

  You will be able to use _Ctrl + Tab on Windows/Linux_ or _^ + Tab on macOS_ again
  to move forward through the list of options, or press _Shift + Tab_ and move backward.
