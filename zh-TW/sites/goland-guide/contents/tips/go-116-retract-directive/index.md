  From the Go documentation for [the retract directive](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-mod-file-retract):

  > A retract directive indicates that a version or range of versions of the module defined by go.mod should not be depended upon. A retract directive is useful when a version was published prematurely or a severe problem was discovered after the version was published.

  **How to use:**

  This feature does not require anything special to be used. The IDE recognizes it automatically.
