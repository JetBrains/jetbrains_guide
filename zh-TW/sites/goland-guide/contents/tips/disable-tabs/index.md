  *Want a cleaner UI with less noise to juggle in your head?*

  There are better choices for moving between files than tabs.
  Let's turn them off.

  Tabs are a great way to focus on the few files for a task. However,
  they have some downsides. Try disabling your tabs as a first step
  towards a more-focused, keyboard-centric workflow.

  **How to use:**
  Control the tab placement to position where the tabs are in the IDE.
  Invoke **Tab placement | None** to hide them completely.
