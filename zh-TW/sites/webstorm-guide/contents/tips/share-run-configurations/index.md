This way, they’ll be able to run the project code using the same configuration settings regardless of what operating systems they are on.

  To share a run configuration, open it in the [Run/Debug Configurations dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/run-debug-configurations-dialog.html), then tick the *Store as project file* checkbox and specify the path to the folder where you want to store the *.run.xml file with the selected run configuration.
