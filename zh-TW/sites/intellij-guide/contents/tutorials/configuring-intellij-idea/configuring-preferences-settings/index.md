## Configuring IntelliJ IDEA
You can use **⌘,** (macOS), or **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**S** (Windows/Linux) to display the Preferences/Settings dialog in IntelliJ IDEA.

These are the broad categories that you can change here, but we recommend being at least a little bit familiar with IntelliJ IDEA before you change too many of them!
- [Appearance & Behaviour](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/appearance-and-behavior.html)
- [Keymap](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-keymap.html)
- [Editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-editor.html)
- [Plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/plugins-settings.html)
- [Version Control](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-version-control.html)
- [Build, Execution, Deployment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-build-execution-deployment.html)
- [Languages & Frameworks](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-languages-and-frameworks.html)
- [Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-tools.html)

The easiest way to navigate around this dialog is to type in what you're looking for. Some examples could be _font_, _folding_, _comments_, _braces_, _commit_, and much more.

If you need to reset your Preferences/Settings back to the default you can use **File** > **Manage IDE Settings** > **Restore Default Settings**.
