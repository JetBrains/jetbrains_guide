## Summary - Configuring IntelliJ IDEA
We've used the following shortcuts in this tutorial:

| Name                     | macOS Shortcut | Windows Shortcut                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Project Structure dialog | **⌘;**         | **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**Shift**+**S** |
| Settings/Preferences     | **⌘,**         | **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**S**           |
| 隨處搜索                     | **⇧⇧**         | **Shift**+**Shift**              |
| Find Action              | **⌘⇧A**        | **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **A**     |

### Key Points
- Build systems such as Maven and Gradle will override settings in your Project Structure
- It's best to be a bit familiar with IntelliJ IDEA before you start customising your Preferences/Settings.
- If you do need to reset your Preferences/Settings, you can do so with **File** > **Manage IDE Settings** > **Restore Default Settings**
- You can also use shortcuts such as Search Everywhere and Find Actions to change your Preferences/Settings.
- You can [export](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) settings to share with your other instances of IntelliJ IDEA.
- You can use a [Settings Repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository) to share settings with your colleagues.
