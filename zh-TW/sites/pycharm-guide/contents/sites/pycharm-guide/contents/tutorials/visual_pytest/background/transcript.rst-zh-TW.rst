Whether its the concepts or the interface, it's hard to get everybody into
testing. In this course, we make testing fun and productive, using PyCharm
as a UI for pytest.


- Setup

We start by making a Python project, following pytest best practices.

- Hello Test

We then write, and run, our first test, using PyCharm as the user interface.

- TDD Flow

It feels good when getting into a test-driven development flow and we
show some tips to layout your workspace to help this.

- Jump to Error

Writing tests before code means errors. PyCharm can help you jump directly
to a problem.

- Skipping Tests

Sometimes you want to silence a test while you're still working on your
code. pytest has decorators which help this.

- Fixtures

You want your tests to focus on logic. pytest provides fixtures as a way
to manage your test data and share it between projects.

- Debugging

TDD means exploring. PyCharm's debugger is a good way to poke around in code.
We show how to combing the benefits of the debugger when writing your tests.

- Testing Exceptions

Sometimes things go wrong, but in an expected way. This last tutorial step
introduces pytest's ``raises`` context manager for testing that exceptions
are raised correctly.

Python testing is a good practice, but with pytest and PyCharm, it's fun
to get into the TDD flow and work productively.
