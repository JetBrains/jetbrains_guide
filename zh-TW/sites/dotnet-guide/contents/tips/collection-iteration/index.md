  **Get your hands some rest!** 😌

  Dealing with collection-like objects is easy if you have **live and postfix templates** at your finger tips. Either write `foreach` as a single word, or add `.foreach` at the end of your collection object. Then, just hit **TAB** and confirm the different hotspot variables: collection object (only live template), type name vs. `var` keyword, and the iteration variable name. In most cases, the **variable name can already be inferred** from the collection object name. Good naming pays off! 😉

  Which way is your favorite? ⭐️
