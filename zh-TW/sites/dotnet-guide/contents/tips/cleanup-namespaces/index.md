  **You know that feeling, right?** 😣

  We're just about to commit our changes and then realize that we have some code smells or dead code left 😵 But there is nothing to worry about! Rider's integrated **side-by-side diff viewer** allows to fix them right from where we are and even in bulk!

  Feel the magic of having VCS support in an IDE! 🥰
