  **Too little space to work with?** 🤨

  If you find yourself frequently resizing tool windows like for VCS or the terminal, then you should try one of the following:

  - With the **Undock** view mode a tool window will automatically hide as soon as it loses focus.
  - Using the **Maximize/restore tool window** action will put the active tool window at maximum available space, and will restore to the previous size on the second call.

  Try it now!️️ 🤓
